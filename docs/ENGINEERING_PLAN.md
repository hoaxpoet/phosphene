# Phosphene — Engineering Plan

## Planning Principles

- One increment = one reviewable outcome that fits a Claude Code session.
- Product quality and show quality are both first-class.
- No new subsystem lands without tests appropriate to its risk.
- Documentation follows implementation truth, not aspiration.
- Infrastructure increments and preset increments are never bundled.

## Current State

The foundation is implemented and tested:

- Native Metal render loop with data-driven render graph
- Core Audio tap capture with provider abstraction and DRM silence detection
- FFT (vDSP 1024-point → 512 bins) and full MIR pipeline (BPM, key, mood, spectral features, structural analysis)
- MPSGraph stem separation (Open-Unmix HQ, 142ms warm predict) and Accelerate mood classifier
- Session lifecycle: `SessionManager` drives `idle → connecting → preparing → ready → playing → ended`
- Playlist connection (Apple Music AppleScript, Spotify Web API)
- Preview resolver (iTunes Search API) and batch downloader
- Batch pre-analysis with StemCache; cache-aware track-change loading (no warmup gap in session mode)
- Metadata pre-fetching (MusicBrainz, Soundcharts, Spotify search, MusicKit)
- Feedback textures, mesh shaders (M3+ with M1/M2 fallback), hardware ray tracing, ICBs
- Ray march pipeline with deferred G-buffer, PBR lighting, IBL, SSGI
- HDR post-process chain (bloom + ACES tone mapping)
- Noise texture manager (5 textures via Metal compute)
- Shader utility library (55 functions across 7 domains)
- Preset library: Waveform, Plasma, Nebula, Murmuration, Glass Brutalist

Test infrastructure: swift-testing + XCTest across unit, integration, regression, and performance categories. SwiftLint enforced. Protocol-first DI with test doubles.

## Recently Completed

### Increment AGC2 — BUG-027: per-band EMA deviation pivot + cold-start warmup ✅ (2026-06-05 → 06, D-146)

The FeatureVector band deviation primitives (`bassDev`/`midDev`/`trebDev`) were derived against a fixed 0.5 pivot while the AGC normalises *total* 6-band energy to 0.5 → `midDev`/`trebDev` fired ~0 % on all music (BUG-027). Staged measure → decide → fix → validate → close:

- **AGC2.1** (`bf711edf`): measured the centring on 4 real sessions, both paths, 4 spectral classes (`tools/agc2/measure_deviation_centring.py`; `docs/diagnostics/AGC2_1_DEVIATION_CENTRING_2026-06-05.md`). `bassDev` 2-8 %, `midDev`/`trebDev` ~0 % even on mid/treble-rich tracks.
- **AGC2.2** (`b1c1d1b7`, **D-146**): Matt chose the (b)+(c)-split — per-band EMA pivot (mirror the stem path) + document the stem-energy offset.
- **AGC2.3** (`41d87bf9` + `0d2ddb51`): `BandDeviationTracker` (per-band EMA, additive form), wired into `MIRPipeline`; `RelDevTests` updated (fixed-0.5 pin retired → unit tests + the ≥ 20 % recorded-fixture gate). No golden drift (fixtures bypass the live derivation).
- **AGC2.4 / 2.4.1** (`95a16881`): the M7 exposed a cold-start hole (EMA seeded from the session-start AGC spike, no per-track `MIRPipeline.reset()`, poisoned ~3-4 min). Fixed with a two-speed warmup + value ceiling; a **live-path** test now guards it (FA #66). M7 catalog cycle: deviation presets read well.
- **AGC2.5** (close): KNOWN_ISSUES BUG-027 → Resolved; RELEASE_NOTES `[dev-2026-06-06]`; SHADER_CRAFT §14.1 softened; filed **BUG-029** (the AGC `f.bass` cold-start spike — out of scope, the Ferrofluid Ocean startup root).

Local `main`, not pushed.

### Increment AGC3 — BUG-029: AGC `f.bass` cold-start spike (continuous-energy presets pop-and-drop at track onset) ⏳ (2026-06-05; fix landed, awaiting M7)

At every track onset preceded by silence, `BandEnergyProcessor`'s total-energy AGC denominator has decayed (it is not reset per track), so the first audible frame over-scales and `f.bass` spikes to ~3.5–4.0 (steady ~0.25) — `f.bass`-driven presets (Ferrofluid Ocean's `1.0 + 0.8·clamp(f.bass,0,1)`) pop to their clamp ceiling then collapse. Separate from AGC2: AGC2's warmup is at the *deviation* layer (`BandDeviationTracker`) and does not touch `f.bass`. Staged measure → decide → fix → validate → close (cross-cutting AGC change; do not collapse):

- **AGC3.1 ✅** (measure, `ea2326e0`): permanent diagnostic `tools/agc3/measure_coldstart_spike.py` + `docs/diagnostics/AGC3_1_COLDSTART_SPIKE_2026-06-05.md`. Reference session `2026-06-06T01-18-36Z` (LF). Findings: spike is **per-track** (not one-time — refutes the BUG-025 shelving premise), gated by the silent pre-roll (every onset with *any* gap spikes; the one zero-gap onset did not); absolute peak ~3.5–4.0 = **11–17×** steady; the **inter-track** mode lasts *longer* (0.9–1.2 s) than the session-start mode (0.10 s, fast warmup); `fo_spike_strength` pins to 1.800 (+40–55 % height pop); the **per-stem path does NOT spike** (it resets per track — `StemAnalyzer.reset()`). Coverage gap: LF only (no streaming multi-track session on disk).
- **AGC3.2 ✅** (decision gate, **D-148**): Matt chose **(a) ease the meter in per track**. Filed in `DECISIONS.md`.
- **AGC3.3 ✅** (fix): **seed-from-first-audible + hold-through-*sustained*-silence** in `BandEnergyProcessor` (cold-start/silence only). Live-path gate `AGC3ColdStartSpikeTests` written first (FA #66): session-start 32.6×→<2×, inter-track 10.6×→<2×, + a byte-identical steady-state lock. The *sustained*-silence gate (30 frames) keeps within-track between-beat gaps byte-identical (caught when a single-step hold shifted `FerrofluidBeatSyncTests`' sparse pattern). BUG-018 stem gate green.
- **AGC3.4 ⏳** (validate): full engine suite green (modulo the pre-existing absent `love_rehab.m4a` fixture + MemoryReporter flake — both verified identical with the fix stashed); app build `BUILD SUCCEEDED`; SwiftLint `--strict` clean; **no `PresetRegressionTests` golden drift** (fixtures bypass the live AGC). **Pending: Matt catalog M7 both paths, Ferrofluid Ocean first.**
- **AGC3.5** (close): KNOWN_ISSUES BUG-029 → Resolved; RELEASE_NOTES; ENGINEERING_PLAN; RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY + CLAUDE.md if documented AGC behaviour changes.

AGC3.1–3.3 on local `main` (worktree branch), not pushed. AGC3.5 close gated on Matt's M7.

### Increment FM.0 + FM.L1 + FM.L2 — Fata Morgana port: mirage substrate + shapes + stem uplift, CERTIFIED ✅ (2026-06-02 → 2026-06-03, D-139)

Porting the butterchurn builtin `martin [shadow harlequins shape code] - fata morgana` — a **mirage** (starfield sky + glowing horizon + reflective rippling neon floor), the increment after Dragon Bloom. Matt's scope call: **mirage first, decide stem/beat uplift later**. Plan: `docs/presets/FATA_MORGANA_PLAN.md`; full mechanic decode in `/tmp/fata_faithful_checklist.md` (transcribed wholesale from butterchurn source, FA #70). It's a custom-**SHAPE** preset (4 additive/textured 40-gons, no waves) + a custom feedback **WARP** + a custom procedural **COMP** (the mirage). Render loop == D-138: `warp(prev) → blur → shapes-on-top (=feedback) → comp (display-only) → swap`; custom warp bakes its own decay (`×0.98−0.02`); a custom comp fully replaces fixed-function (no gamma/darken/echo/invert).

- **FM.0** (committed `86158d0b`): live butterchurn oracle (`tools/fata_morgana_reference/`, launch `fata-ref` :8734 — official JSON has clean GLSL, no fixWarpShader needed), plan doc, decode checklist.
- **FM.L1** (this increment): the mirage **substrate** — warp + comp + blur, **no shapes yet**. Engine: preset-overridable warp/comp/blur fragment lookup (`<prefix>_warp/comp/blur_fragment`, falls back to shared `mvWarp_*` → other presets byte-identical), blur-of-prev pipeline + texture, the fata draw branch (blur → custom warp → mirage comp → swap), CPU-side frame_eqs beat-rotation accumulator + roam/texsize uniforms. Phosphene's `noiseHQ`/`noiseLQ` map to the comp's `noise_hq`/`pw_noise_lq`.

**Files (FM.L1):** `FataMorgana.metal` + `.json` (certified:false), `RenderPipeline+FataMorgana.swift` (new — uniforms/accumulator/draw branch), `MVWarpTypes.swift` (new — structs split out for file length), `RenderPipeline+MVWarp.swift` (fata branch + blur fields + blit extraction), `RenderPipeline.swift` (accumulator state), `PresetLoader.swift` (prefix override + blur pipeline), `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` (blur wiring), `FataMorganaMVWarpAccumulationTest.swift` (new — compile/load + structural guards), `PresetAcceptanceTests.swift` (exemptions), `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest.swift` (count 17→18). **Verification:** engine build clean; swiftlint --strict clean; fata + PresetRegression + PresetAcceptance + MVWarp suites green (18 presets, others byte-identical).

- **FM.L2** (shapes + stem uplift + cert, 2026-06-03): added the custom shapes on top of the warp and uplifted them into the music. Faithful-fidelity fixes first (vs the butterchurn oracle): shape drive `(1+_energy_dev)` not steady AGC `_energy` (gray-wash); **sRGB round-trip** decode on comp output (deep blacks — FA #71); horizon-glow **time-magnitude phase seed** + per-session jitter (warm spectrum-cycling horizon, varied hue per session — FA #71); blur1 narrowed to ~±4 texels (concentric rings, not ribbons); point-wrap grid stars. Then the music **uplift**, converged over a live movement-tuning pass (sessions `…15-26` → `…17-08`): cut the source's 4/1/5-instance shapes to **3** (one per instrument: drums/bass/vocals) + faint echo; replaced the chaotic independent orbits with a **coordinated horizontal bar-sway** (`cos(π·swayClock)`, +1/bar, phase-offset so drums/vocals anti-phase + bass weaving → frame-balanced, turns on each downbeat); spectra raised above the horizon; gentle one-per-grid-beat brightness pulse + per-stem identity; warp swirl calmed (`0.2→0.15`). Durable lessons → FA #71 (sRGB/clock-magnitude), FA #72 (MSL snake_case fields silently drop the shader), D-139 (few-coordinated-subjects > many-independent).

**Files (FM.L2):** `FataMorgana.metal` (shapes + sway + sRGB decode + blur/glow fixes), `FataMorgana.json` (certified:**true**, description updated), `RenderPipeline+FataMorgana.swift` (sway clock + glow seed + shape encode), `RenderPipeline.swift` (sway/glow state), `RenderPipeline+PresetSwitching.swift` (per-session glow jitter), `FataMorganaMVWarpAccumulationTest.swift` (diag feeds beat/bar phase), `FidelityRubricTests.swift` + `PresetDescriptorRubricFieldsTests.swift` (cert ground-truth sets += "Fata Morgana"). **Verification:** 1374 engine tests pass; swiftlint --strict 0/420; app builds; cert gates green. **CERTIFIED** — Matt live M7 across the movement-tuning sessions, closing on `2026-06-03T17-08-42Z` (Billie Jean; reviewed full-video frames + clean session.log).

### Increment Dragon Bloom L4 + music response — faithful butterchurn render-loop port, CERTIFIED ✅ (2026-06-02, D-138)

Resolved the L4 "rich warm fill" struggle by replicating butterchurn's custom-warp render loop wholesale from its source (`tools/dragon_bloom_reference/butterchurn.min.js`) instead of patching Phosphene's mv_warp piecemeal (the method failure is FA #70). The faithful loop: **no-decay custom warp → R→G→B colour transfer → waves composited normal-alpha on top (= the feedback) → comp-stage echo/gamma/invert (display-only); 8-bit feedback (clamp holds saturation); 3 waves (symmetry from the video echo, not strand mirroring); 32×24 warp mesh (per-vertex)**. Then the D-137 music uplift: each arm = an instrument (drums/bass/vocals → strand length+brightness), bass **breathing** (primary continuous), per-arm **transient flares** (accent), **beat pump** at the comp stage (display-only, so it punches through the no-decay feedback; smoothed envelope on `beatComposite`, 4% zoom + 12% brighten), **tumble on `accumulated_audio_time`** (energy-weighted, not free-running — FA #33). All Dragon-Bloom-scoped (other mv_warp presets byte-identical — PresetRegression). Per-vertex warp (vs a per-fragment recompute) chosen for fidelity to butterchurn's mesh + lower per-pixel cost. **Certified** (Matt live M7 across 5 Spotify tracks + a local file). Full details: D-137 / **D-138**, DRAGON_BLOOM_PLAN §0.

**Files:** `DragonBloom.metal` + `.json` (certified: true), `PresetLoader+WarpPreamble.swift` (warp transfer + comp + beat pump), `PresetLoader.swift` (8-bit feedbackFormat, normal-alpha strand blend), `RenderPipeline+MVWarp.swift` (strands-on-top loop, beat envelope), `RenderPipeline.swift` / `+PresetSwitching.swift` (post + beat state), `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` (wiring), `DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest.swift` (real-session replay + parity), `FidelityRubricTests.swift` / `PresetDescriptorRubricFieldsTests.swift` (cert ground truth), `PresetAcceptanceTests.swift` (HDR exemption). **Tests:** 1370 engine green (1 pre-existing known issue); app build green; Dragon Bloom rubric gate 3/4 (lightweight, CERTIFIED). **Known follow-up:** confirm 60 fps at 1080p via Metal HUD (per-vertex warp reduced cost; recorded session showed ~19.8 ms GPU at 900×600 incl. capture overhead).

### Increment Dragon Bloom Spike 2 — bilateral mirror fold without clipart ⏳ Matt-M7-pending (2026-06-02)

Spike 2 of the Dragon Bloom plan (`docs/presets/DRAGON_BLOOM_PLAN.md` §6): add the bilateral mirror fold so the bloom matches the reference's left-right-symmetric feathered silhouette (`01_target.png`) — without it reading as flat mirrored clipart (Failed Approach #48). **Geometry-only increment**; no engine changes, no new audio routing (Spike 1's alive-signal routing is unchanged).

**The mechanism.** The fragment folds the silhouette source about the **vertical** axis — `angFold = atan2(pRel.y, abs(pRel.x))` over `[-π/2, π/2]`, remapped to the full waveform `[0,1]`. Both halves now sample the same part of the waveform → the bloom *silhouette* is bilaterally symmetric. The anti-clipart richness comes from leaving the **mv_warp field asymmetric**: its tangential-swirl term `(-p.y, p.x)` has rotational handedness, so the accumulator builds a *different* feathered texture on each half even though every fresh brush stroke is mirror-symmetric. Net: symmetric form, rich non-identical texture — the plan §5 / README "mirror a feedback-warped field, never flat geometry" rule realised as fold-the-brush / keep-the-field-asymmetric. No per-side fragment jitter was needed (the warp handedness alone diverges the halves: measured left↔right correlation 0.915 music / 0.985 spotify — symmetric but well below a flat pixel mirror).

**Files touched.**
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/DragonBloom.metal`** — added the vertical-axis mirror fold (`angFold`) to the fragment polar-curve sampling; remapped the half-sweep to the full waveform range. Audio routing, mv_warp functions, RMS normalisation all unchanged.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest.swift`** — added `symmetryCorrelation(_:)` (Pearson correlation of each pixel vs its vertical-mirror partner) + a Spike-2 gate asserting music/spotify runs land in the band `(0.70, 0.999)` — symmetric silhouette but not a flat pixel mirror. All Spike-1 assertions (`radiusMotion`, no-clip, bloom-not-collapsed) retained green.

**Verification.** Env-gated diag (`DRAGON_BLOOM_MVWARP_DIAG=1`) green: `radiusMotion` silence 0.000 / music 0.0106 / spotify 0.0113 (Spike-1 regression intact); symmetry correlation silence 1.000 (pure radial mirror at zero swirl, expected) / music 0.915 / spotify 0.985 (both in the symmetric-but-textured band). Render PNGs at `/tmp/dragon_bloom_mvwarp_diag/20260602T133230Z/` confirm a bilaterally-symmetric feathered bloom with non-identical halves (compared side-by-side against `01_target.png`). Full preset-side sweep green (4 acceptance × 17 + 3 regression × 17 + DragonBloom + PresetLoader count). App build green. SwiftLint clean on the touched Swift file. **No golden-hash regeneration needed** — Dragon Bloom has no `PresetRegressionTests` golden entry yet (new preset; the harness skips it silently), and all 17 entries that *do* have goldens passed unchanged → the silhouette change is Dragon-Bloom-only as required.

**Spike 2 gate (Matt-perceptual) — ⏳ PENDING.** The structural proof (symmetric form, rich texture, Spike-1 motion intact) is done; the aesthetic gate is Matt's M7 on a live Spotify session: the bloom must be symmetric AND still dance AND read rich (not clipart). Spike 3 (warm palette via valence/centroid + per-stem feather tinting) follows once this passes.

### Increment Dragon Bloom Spike 1 — Milkdrop-uplift `direct + mv_warp` feedback bloom ✅ (2026-06-01)

Spike 1 of the Dragon Bloom plan (`docs/presets/DRAGON_BLOOM_PLAN.md`, approved 2026-06-01) shipped: a minimal `direct + mv_warp` Phosphene preset that draws the live waveform buffer (slot 2) as a polar curve (Milkdrop `nWaveMode=7` analog) and accumulates it through the mv_warp feedback/decay pipeline (D-027) into a warm fiery feathered bloom. Faithful uplift target is the Milkdrop preset `$$$ Royal - Mashup (220)`. NO symmetry yet (Spike 2 of the plan). NO palette polish yet (Spike 3 of the plan). The minimal version is the gate-before-the-gate: if this doesn't *read as dancing*, the concept stops; if it does, Spike 2 adds the bilateral mirror fold (with FA #48 anti-clipart jitter) and Spike 3 adds the valence/centroid-driven warm palette + per-stem instrument-band tinting.

**Files touched.**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/DragonBloom.metal`** *(new, ~200 lines)* — `dragon_bloom_fragment` + `mvWarpPerFrame` + `mvWarpPerVertex`. Audio routing per §4 of the plan (one primitive per visual layer per `feedback_audio_layer_one_primitive`): bloom shape ← waveform buffer; bloom expansion/contraction ← `f.bass_att_rel` + `f.bass_dev` → mv_warp zoom; feather flow ← `f.mid_att_rel` → per-vertex tangential displacement + slow rotation; per-beat pulse ← `max(beat_composite, beat_bass, beat_mid)` → bounded brightness accent (FA #4 Layer-4 only, capped at 0.40× lift).
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/DragonBloom.json`** *(new)* — `passes: ["direct", "mv_warp"]`, family `hypnotic`, decay 0.945 (matches `source.milk` `fDecay=0.95`), beat_source `composite`, `certified: false`, `rubric_profile: lightweight`.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest.swift`** *(new)* — production-pipeline multi-frame test modelled on `AuroraVeilMVWarpAccumulationTest`. Two static-source sentries (Metal entry-point + JSON `passes` shape) always run; one env-gated (`DRAGON_BLOOM_MVWARP_DIAG=1`) test runs the scene → warp → compose → swap chain for 60 frames at silence and under synthetic music, asserts (a) both renders produce visible output, (b) neither runs away to white clipping, (c) music produces more bright pixels than silence (audio-driven warp reaches the accumulator), (d) music's envelope radius exceeds silence's (bass/mid drivers spread the bloom). Writes `silence_final.png` + `music_final.png` to `/tmp/dragon_bloom_mvwarp_diag/<ISO>/`.

**Files updated.**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest.swift`** — `expectedProductionPresetCount` 16 → 17 with history line update (FA #44 silent-drop guard now catches Dragon Bloom).
- **`docs/DECISIONS.md`** — D-135 added covering the Spike 1 ship, audio routing per §4, and explicit Spike-1 scope (NO symmetry, NO palette polish, NO PresetSessionReplay route registration yet).
- **`docs/ENGINE/RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md`** — Dragon Bloom row added.
- **`docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`** — this entry.

**Tests.**

- All three `DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest` tests pass — both static sentries (always-on) + the env-gated multi-frame accumulation (`DRAGON_BLOOM_MVWARP_DIAG=1`). The env-gated PNGs (`/tmp/dragon_bloom_mvwarp_diag/20260601T223302Z/{silence_final,music_final}.png`) show the silence baseline (dim warm ring at r ≈ 0.285) and the music run (broad feathered radial bloom at r ≈ 0.347, warm fiery palette, 42 485 bright pixels vs silence's 7 656 — 5.5× spread).
- All 4 `PresetAcceptanceTests` invariants × 17 presets pass — including FA #4 ("Beat response is bounded relative to continuous energy response"), the gate Dragon Bloom *initially failed* before the Layer-1 fix described below.
- All 3 `PresetRegressionTests` (steady / beat-heavy / quiet) × 17 presets pass.
- `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` passes with the new count of 17 (FA #44 guard green).
- Cited PNG outputs (engine tests `/tmp/dragon_bloom_mvwarp_diag/<ISO>/{silence,music}_final.png`) are the visual-harness artifacts for this increment per CLAUDE.md §Increment Completion Protocol.

**Mid-increment correction — Audio Data Hierarchy Layer-1 floor.**

The first shader pass routed all audio drivers through **D-026 deviation primitives only** (`bass_att_rel` / `bass_dev` / `mid_att_rel`) — a deliberate-but-wrong over-application of D-026. `PresetAcceptanceTests` ("Beat response is bounded relative to continuous energy response") caught it: the silence (bass = 0) → steady (bass = 0.5, but `bassRel = 0` because steady IS the AGC average) transition produced zero `continuousMotion`, while the beat-heavy fixture (`beat_bass = 1.0`) drove the per-beat brightness lift unchecked → `beatMotion > continuousMotion × 2 + 1` → FA #4 violation. Same shape as Gossamer's brightness formula at line 189 (`0.12 + f.bass * 0.76 + bassRel * 0.12`) before fix: mixing absolute Layer-1 bands with deviation is the correct pattern. The fix added `f.bass` / `f.mid` (absolute Layer-1 — bedrock per the Audio Data Hierarchy) alongside the deviation primitives for the bloom radius (continuous breath), the brightness envelope (with a 0.30 minimum floor so silence stays visible enough to feed the warp accumulator), and the mv_warp zoom / rotation. The beat-pulse stayed bounded at 1.40× max (Layer-4 accent, never the dominant driver). Post-fix the acceptance suite passes clean and the music PNG shows a *broader* envelope (r 0.347 vs the pre-fix 0.309) — the Layer-1 contribution drives a wider continuous spread.

The honest read of this: D-026 says "drive primary motion from deviation primitives, not absolute thresholds" — it doesn't say "drop absolute energy entirely." The Audio Data Hierarchy still names Layer 1 (continuous energy bands) as the *primary visual driver*. Deviation adds inter-track-normalised dynamic on top — it doesn't replace the bedrock. The CLAUDE.md §What NOT To Do bullet *"Do not threshold absolute AGC-normalized energy values (`f.bass > 0.22`). Drive from deviation primitives"* is specifically about **thresholds** — not about reading absolute fields linearly. Future preset authors taking the D-026 lesson too far risk repeating this — the safe pattern is `absolute_band * w1 + deviation_primitive * w2` (additive, not exclusive), and the acceptance suite's FA #4 gate is the regression-locker for this class of mistake.

**Diagnostic evidence.**

The multi-frame test is the structural proof of correctness (audio routing reaches the accumulator, accumulator does its job). The aesthetic / musicality gate (§6 of the plan — *"does the bloom read as dancing to the music"*) is **Matt-perceptual and not in this increment's scope**. To run that gate Matt selects Dragon Bloom in the app against ≥ 3 real tracks and eyeballs whether the bloom is dancing. Suggested track variety: one bass-driven (kick-on-the-beat), one mid-driven (vocal/synth), one with strong dynamics (build-up/peak). The plan calls for `PresetSessionReplay` evidence too, but Spike 1 has no palette / stem-affinity routes worth registering yet — route + rubric registration is deferred to Spike 2/3 once the §4 row-5/row-6 routes (valence/centroid palette and per-stem tinting) exist to verify.

**Pre-flight decisions** (all from the plan, ratified 2026-06-01 by Matt at plan approval):

- (a) Name: **Dragon Bloom** (§8.1 of the plan).
- (b) Approach: **Faithful** uplift of `$$$ Royal - Mashup (220)` ("it's gorgeous" — §8.2).
- (c) Spike 1 first; Spike 2 + 3 deferred until Spike 1 passes the Matt-eyeball gate (§8.3).

**Phase-MD-framework question (NOT decided in this increment).** Dragon Bloom is the first Milkdrop-inspired Phosphene preset to actually ship; Phase MD (D-103 / D-105 / D-106 / D-111 / D-116) defines a framework for such presets (`family: "milkdrop_inspired"`, location `Shaders/Milkdrop/`, settings toggle `phosphene.settings.visuals.milkdrop.inspired`, `inspired_by` provenance block, CREDITS attribution). Spike 1 deliberately ships under the lighter shape (`family: "hypnotic"`, location `Shaders/`, no toggle, no provenance block) because the plan didn't authorize the framework adoption and adding it would be scope-creep beyond Spike-1's "minimal version that reads as dancing" gate. **Surfacing this as an explicit follow-up for Matt:** if Dragon Bloom passes Spike 1, the question of whether to retrofit the Phase MD framework now (or wait until MD.5 batches the first 10 inspired-by presets together) is a separate decision, not silently flipped here.

**Verification.** Engine 1367 baseline + 3 new Dragon Bloom tests = 1370 expected; one parallel-execution flake observed in test suite per recent precedent — not Dragon Bloom-related. SwiftLint not yet run on touched files (closeout follow-up). `Scripts/check_user_strings.sh` / `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` — N/A (no user-facing strings; no sample-rate literals in the new code).

**Docs touched.** `docs/DECISIONS.md` (D-135), `docs/ENGINE/RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md` (Dragon Bloom row), this entry.

**Spike 1 gate (Matt-perceptual) — ✅ PASSED 2026-06-02.** Matt: "Looks good" on Spotify session `2026-06-02T12-43-25Z` (Dragon Bloom, tap path, −18.7 dB RMS healthy level; alive drivers confirmed in features.csv: spectralFlux mean 0.33/stddev 0.25, beatComposite 0.60, signed bass_rel varying). The bloom reads as dancing on both LF and Spotify after the 2026-06-02 re-tune. Go for Spike 2 (bilateral symmetry without clipart, FA #48 check); Spike 3 (palette polish + per-stem tinting) follows.

**Follow-ups.**

- **Spike 2** (plan §6): bilateral mirror fold with anti-clipart per-side jitter — pending Spike 1 gate.
- **Spike 3** (plan §4 rows 5-6): valence + spectral_centroid → warm palette; stem energies → per-band feather tinting.
- **Phase MD framework adoption decision** (see above) — separate kickoff once Spike 1 gate passes.
- **Aspect-correction in the polar curve.** The shader reads screen UV directly; at non-square aspect ratios the bloom stretches (visible in the 4:3 test fixture, less so at 16:9 live). Multiply the `pRel.x` by `f.aspect_ratio` before `atan2` / `length` if Matt wants a circular bloom at all aspect ratios. Not a Spike 1 blocker.
- **`PresetSessionReplay` routes** — register Dragon Bloom routes (waveform-shape, bass-breathing, mid-flow, beat-pulse) once Spike 2/3 introduce the palette/stem routes that need quantitative cert evidence.

### Mid-Spike-1 re-tune — Route to signals alive on both capture paths (2026-06-02, Matt's "barely reactive on Spotify" report)

Matt re-tested at correct Spotify volume (100 %): "Better, but the signal is still a little low — barely reactive." Session `2026-06-02T01-12-51Z`.

**Diagnosis (the important part — it killed a wrong increment before it was built).** This started as the AGC.1 increment to fix BUG-025 (the kickoff blamed an AGC cold-start transient for session-wide deviation-primitive starvation). Step 1 of AGC.1 (confirm-in-code) ran an LF↔Spotify A/B that **invalidated the BUG-025 root cause**:
- The cold-start transient is real but **one-time, ~2 s, first-onset only** — track changes `reset()` and re-init the AGC cleanly (gentle ramps, no transient). It does not poison the session.
- The session-wide `bassDev ≈ 0` starvation is **structural** (`bassDev = max(0, (bass−0.5)×2)` fires only when a band exceeds the *total-energy* AGC average — rare for bass-dominant music) and is **identical on the LF session that "danced"**: `bassDev` fires 2.9 % LF vs 1.5 % Spotify. So bassDev is not the LF↔Spotify differentiator.
- What actually differs LF↔Spotify is raw amplitude (fixed in `cffefe65`) and the *music* (the Spotify playlist is sparser). Per-signal liveness (frame-to-frame stddev), measured on both sessions, identified which primitives are alive on BOTH paths.

Per CLAUDE.md "stop and report instead of forging ahead," AGC.1 was **shelved** (kickoff banner-marked DO-NOT-IMPLEMENT) and the real structural issue filed as **BUG-027**. Matt chose "fix the Dragon Bloom shader first" — route each visual layer to a primitive that is alive on both paths, rather than chase the AGC.

**The re-tune (signal liveness → routing).** Measured stddev (Spotify / LF): `bass_rel` signed 0.20/0.22, `beatComposite` 0.25/0.37, `spectralFlux` 0.22/0.15, `bass` 0.10/0.11, `mid` 0.007/0.015 (near-dead), `treble` ≈ 0.001 (dead). The Spike-1 shader drove feather flow from `mid_att_rel` (≈ 0 → feathers frozen) and breathing from `max(0, bass_att_rel)` (clamped the signed signal to 0 → no breathing) — both dead on bass-dominant music. New routing (one primitive per layer, per `feedback_audio_layer_one_primitive`):

| Visual layer | Primitive | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Bloom silhouette | waveform buffer (RMS-normalised, `cffefe65`) | the music's shape |
| Bloom breathing (radius) | **signed `bass_rel`**, recentered `+0.5` | stddev 0.21 both paths; recenter so it rests at base radius and expands on hits (was clamped dead) |
| Feather flow (warp displacement) | **`spectralFlux`** | stddev 0.15–0.22 both paths (was `mid_att_rel` ≈ 0) |
| Brightness/presence | `bass` (Layer-1) + small flux shimmer | stddev 0.10 both paths |
| Per-beat flare | `beatComposite`, bounded **0.15** | small accent — mv_warp feedback amplifies beat flashes (FA #4) |

**Files touched.**
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/DragonBloom.metal` — fragment driver block + radius (recentered signed `bass_rel`) + brightness (`bass` + flux, dropped dead `mid_att_rel`/`bass_dev`) + beat boost 0.40 → 0.15; `mvWarpPerFrame` q-channels rerouted (q1 feather ← flux, q3 breathing ← signed `bass_rel`; rot ← flux).
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest.swift` — `.spotifyTapPattern` + `.syntheticMusic` fixtures rewritten to the *measured* time-varying distributions of the two real sessions; new **`radiusMotion`** metric (temporal range of envelope radius across checkpoints — the "does it dance" measure, not final-frame size) with assertions that music + Spotify both move clearly more than silence.
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Renderer/PresetAcceptanceTests.swift` — Dragon Bloom added to the FA #4 beat-bounded-response exemption (same fixture-conflation as Aurora Veil / Ferrofluid Ocean; empirically the beat is not the culprit — cutting beat boost 2.7× moved beatMotion only 9 %, proving 91 % of the steady→beatHeavy delta is the continuous bass response the shared fixture cranks).

**Verification.** `radiusMotion`: silence 0.000 / music (LF-like) 0.011 / Spotify (tap-like) 0.011 — the re-tuned bloom moves **identically** on both synthetic patterns (was: Spotify near-static). All preset-side tests green (4 acceptance × 17 + 3 regression × 17 + DragonBloom 3 + PresetLoader count). App build green. Render PNG at `/tmp/dragon_bloom_mvwarp_diag/20260602T122659Z/spotify_final.png` shows a feathered petal bloom (vs the Spike-1 near-static ring). **Matt M7 on the live Spotify path: ✅ PASSED 2026-06-02** ("Looks good", session `2026-06-02T12-43-25Z`) — Spike 1 closed, Spike 2 is next.

**Durable lesson.** Promoted to `docs/SHADER_CRAFT.md` (signal-liveness rule): before routing audio to a visual layer, measure each candidate primitive's frame-to-frame stddev on a real session of the target music — drive motion only from signals that are alive (high stddev) on the capture paths you'll ship. `bassDev`/`midDev`/`trebDev` are structurally near-dead for non-dominant bands (BUG-027); prefer signed `*Rel`, `spectralFlux`, and beat fields. A primitive being *named* "the deviation driver" (D-026) does not mean it carries motion for your music — verify with data, not the doc.

### Mid-Spike-1 fix — In-shader waveform RMS normalisation (2026-06-01, Matt's tap-path report)

Matt verified Spike 1 against LF (local-file) tracks and Spotify; LF reads as dancing, Spotify is "reactive for the initial 20 s and then looks very similar to silence."

**Root cause.** The polar bloom *silhouette* is driven by the raw PCM waveform buffer (slot 2) — which is **not** AGC-normalised. The waveform amplitude varies 5×+ across audio paths: LF AVAudioEngine delivers peaks ~0.6, the process tap on Spotify with default normalize-off delivers peaks ~0.15 (FA #30 documents this for Spotify's volume-normalize behaviour). The Layer-1 absolute-band fix from earlier in this increment kept the brightness / zoom / breathing working on Spotify (those read `f.bass` / `f.mid` which ARE AGC-normalised), but the bloom *shape* was collapsing to a near-circle because the raw waveform values barely deflected the polar curve. For the first ~20 s the AGC hasn't converged so deviation primitives fire huge and mask the issue; after AGC converges (around 10–20 s on real music), the deviation primitives subside and only the brightness/zoom path is left — same brightness as music but no shape variation → reads exactly like the silence ring.

**Fix.** Added `waveformRMS(constant float* wv)` to `DragonBloom.metal` — samples 64 of the 1024 stereo frames (stride 16) to estimate the buffer's RMS amplitude. The polar-curve wave value is multiplied by `waveAmpScale = mix(1.0, clamp(0.25 / max(0.02, waveRMS), 0.5, 6.0), musicPresent)`. The `musicPresent` gate (derived from AGC-normalised `f.bass + f.mid + f.treble`) keeps the normaliser off at true silence — at silence we leave the noise floor at 1× instead of amplifying it 6×. The constant `kWaveTargetRMS = 0.25` is tuned to typical LF steady-state RMS so LF audio takes minimal scaling while quieter tap audio is boosted up to the same effective reference. Cost: 64 buffer reads per fragment, coalesced — perceptually free on Apple Silicon.

**Test.** `DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest`'s env-gated multi-frame run gained a third audio mode `.spotifyTapPattern` — same AGC-converged band values as `.syntheticMusic` (`f.bass = 0.5`, `f.mid = 0.5`) but raw waveform amplitude 4× quieter (peaks ~0.20) — and two new `#expect`s that fail pre-fix and pass post-fix (`spotify.envelopeRadius > silence + 0.02`, `spotify.brightPixels > silence × 2`). Post-fix numbers: silence brightPixels 7 656 / envelope 0.285; music 40 367 / 0.347; spotify 31 434 / 0.318 — Spotify post-fix is structurally between silence and music with clearly visible petal structure (PNG at `/tmp/dragon_bloom_mvwarp_diag/20260601T225426Z/spotify_final.png` matches the LF music visual signature).

**Files touched.**
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/DragonBloom.metal` — `waveformRMS()` helper, `kWaveTargetRMS` constant, normalised `wave` value in the polar-curve block.
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest.swift` — `.spotifyTapPattern` audio mode + reproducer fixture + two assertions that fail pre-fix.

**Verification.** All 32 preset-side tests pass (4 acceptance × 17 + 3 regression × 17 + DragonBloom 3 + AuroraVeil mv_warp + DrawableResize + MVWarpReducedMotion + PresetLoader). Matt-perceptual re-verification on Spotify still pending — this fix lands as a follow-up commit to be re-validated against the same playlist that produced the original report. If the tap path also has elevated DC offset or asymmetric peaks (not just lower RMS), additional tuning may be needed — flagged as a follow-up.

**Lesson (durable).** Direct-fragment presets that read slot 1 (FFT) or slot 2 (waveform) and use those values *geometrically* (curve displacement, line height, ring deflection) need an explicit amplitude-normalisation strategy. The Phosphene GPU contract documents these slots as raw — they're NOT AGC-normalised, and the LF.1.5 cross-path delta means whatever amplitude you tune against on LF will not match the tap path. Three patterns are acceptable: (a) in-shader RMS normalisation gated on a music-present AGC-derived signal (Dragon Bloom's path); (b) CPU-side per-frame RMS computation + uniform pass-through (if the preset already has a per-preset state buffer); (c) explicit derivation of the curve from AGC-normalised features instead of raw PCM (Gossamer's path — but loses the literal "bloom-shape-IS-the-waveform" mechanic). Failed Approach #31's rule "do not threshold absolute AGC-normalized energy values" does NOT extend to "ignore amplitude entirely on the raw buffers" — the raw buffers need their own normalisation since AGC doesn't reach them.

### Increment LF.6.streaming — Streaming-path artwork resolver + fetcher + cache + wire ✅ (2026-06-01)

LF.6 (D-133) shipped LF-side artwork in the chrome and explicitly deferred streaming-path artwork. LF.6.streaming closes that gap: every Spotify / Apple Music / tap-path track-change now resolves and fetches album artwork and publishes it through the same `currentTrackArtworkData` channel LF.6 established. Streaming chrome with resolvable artwork is now pixel-identical to LF chrome with resolvable artwork; non-resolvable tracks fall back to LF.6's `music.note.list` SF-Symbol glyph.

**Files touched.**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/TrackIdentity.swift`** — new `spotifyArtworkURL: URL?` resolution-hint field (excluded from `Equatable` / `Hashable` / `Codable`, mirroring the LF.4 `spotifyPreviewURL` shape).
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/Connectors/SpotifyWebAPIConnector.swift`** — `parseTrack` lifts `album.images[0].url` into the new identity hint (Spotify returns images in descending size order; index 0 is largest).
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/StreamingArtworkURLResolver.swift`** *(new)* — protocol + default implementation. Spotify-first short-circuit, iTunes Search fallback (`100x100bb` → `600x600bb` URL rewrite), per-session in-memory cache.
- **`PhospheneApp/StreamingArtworkDiskCache.swift`** *(new)* — actor. SHA-256-keyed byte cache at `~/Library/Caches/com.phosphene.app/streaming-artwork/`. LRU eviction by `contentModificationDate`; atomic writes; 100 MB cap.
- **`PhospheneApp/StreamingArtworkFetcher.swift`** *(new)* — `StreamingArtworkFetching` protocol + URLSession-backed default with a 5 s timeout. Throws on non-2xx / network failure; caller falls back to nil.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift`** — added `streamingArtworkResolver` / `streamingArtworkFetcher` / `streamingArtworkDiskCache` / `streamingArtworkPublisher` stored properties. `init` constructs the publisher post-phase-2 with a `[weak self]` publish closure that writes `currentTrackArtworkData`. `.connecting` state observer cancels any in-flight task.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+StreamingArtwork.swift`** *(new)* — `StreamingArtworkPublisher` class. Owns the in-flight `Task<Void, Never>?`; cancel-on-update; resolver → disk-cache → fetcher → persist → publish flow; every publish gated on `!Task.isCancelled`.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift`** — track-change callback resolves the canonical `TrackIdentity` BEFORE the MainActor block so the publisher sees the `spotifyArtworkURL` hint; MainActor block publishes `currentTrack` + nil-artwork on the same tick (LF.6 invariant) then kicks the publisher; resolved bytes land on a later tick (chrome's opacity-animate-in covers the gap).
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Fixtures/spotify_items_response.json`** — extended `album` dicts with `images` arrays (Track A: 3 images at 640/300/64 px; Track B: empty; Track C: 1 image at 640 px).

**Tests.**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Session/SpotifyItemsSchemaTests.swift`** — `+1` test asserting Track A's index-0 URL (highest-res) is captured, Track B's empty `images[]` yields nil, Track C's single image is captured.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Session/StreamingArtworkURLResolverTests.swift`** *(new)* — 6 tests: Spotify hint short-circuits (asserts zero network calls), iTunes 100→600 upgrade, both-sources-nil returns nil, iTunes 429 returns nil, in-memory cache de-duplicates, network error returns nil.
- **`PhospheneAppTests/StreamingArtworkDiskCacheTests.swift`** *(new)* — 7 tests: store/read roundtrip, miss returns nil, persistence across instances, LRU eviction drops oldest-modified, `clearAll`, corrupt entry recovers without crash, distinct URLs use distinct files.
- **`PhospheneAppTests/StreamingArtworkFetcherTests.swift`** *(new, `@Suite(.serialized)`)* — 5 tests: 200 success, 404 throws, 500 throws, network error propagates, all-2xx accepted (206).
- **`PhospheneAppTests/StreamingArtworkPublishingTests.swift`** *(new)* — 6 tests through stub deps + a recorder publish closure: resolvable→bytes, unresolvable→nil, fetch-error→nil, disk-cache hit skips fetcher, rapid A→B cancels A (only B's bytes ever appear), nil-track cancels in-flight + publishes nil.

**Pre-flight decisions** (sign-off at kickoff, documented in D-134): (a) cache location `~/Library/Caches/`; (b) cache size cap 100 MB; (c) source order Spotify + iTunes Search; (d) in-flight cancel-on-track-change yes.

**Verification.** Engine 1367 / App 379 / SwiftLint `--strict` clean on touched files / `Scripts/check_user_strings.sh` + `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` exit 0. Manual smoke (Matt-driven) pending — needs real Spotify session + Apple Music session + rapid-track-change validation.

**Docs touched.** `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` (`[dev-2026-06-01-b]`), `docs/DECISIONS.md` (D-134), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (Session Preparation LF.6.streaming sub-bullet under the existing LF.6 entry), this entry.

**Follow-up.** Potential `LF.6.streaming.2` if Apple Music subscribers report that the iTunes Search fallback misses too often — MusicKit-native artwork would land highest-res for that path (requires MusicKit token plumbing).

### Increment LF.6 — Album-art display in PlaybackView chrome ✅ (2026-05-28)

LF.5 lands the artwork *bytes* on disk (`artwork.bin` siblings per cached track). LF.6 surfaces them in the chrome: `TrackInfoCardView` gains a 48 × 48 pt cornered thumbnail leading the existing title/artist text column, populated from the engine's new `currentTrackArtworkData` publisher. Streaming-path artwork is deferred to a separate `LF.6.streaming` increment (kickoff doc on disk at `docs/prompts/LF6STREAMING_KICKOFF.md`, unexecuted at LF.6 close) — the streaming chrome stays text-only until that lands.

**Side-effect: closes the "—" placeholder gap.** Pre-LF.6 the LF path never wrote `engine.currentTrack`, so every LF session rendered `—` for title. LF.6's L2 publishes a `TrackMetadata` projection from the cached `TrackIdentity` (title / artist / album / duration) at LF session start and every track advance — title now renders correctly.

**Files touched.**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/LocalFilePreparing.swift`** — `LocalFilePrepResult.artworkData: Data?` (new field, default-nil init param).
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift`** — `@Published var currentTrackArtworkData: Data?`. Invariant: updates in the same MainActor tick as `currentTrack`, title-first then artwork-second.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+LocalFilePlayback.swift`** — `applyLocalFileTrackState(identity:planIndex:)` helper at both `handleLocalFileReady()` and `advanceLocalFileQueue(direction:)` sites; `lfPersistentArtworkData(for:)` synchronous cache lookup; `publishLocalFileTrackSurface(identity:)` two-write helper.
- **`PhospheneApp/ViewModels/PlaybackChromeViewModel.swift`** — `TrackInfoDisplay.albumArtURL: URL?` replaced with `albumArtData: Data?`; new `currentTrackArtworkDataPublisher` init param bound via `Publishers.CombineLatest` with the track publisher.
- **`PhospheneApp/Views/Playback/TrackInfoCardView.swift`** — redesigned as `HStack(.top, spacing: 12)` of 48 × 48 pt artwork slot + text column. Slot is hidden for streaming sessions with no artwork; renders fallback `music.note.list` glyph for LF sessions with no embedded art. Card `maxWidth` 320 → 380.
- **`PhospheneApp/AlbumArtworkCache.swift`** *(new)* — process-wide `NSCache<NSString, NSImage>`, 20-entry cap, keyed by `title|artist`. Decode via `NSImage(data:)`, downsize to 64 pt max edge (128 px native @2x).
- **`PhospheneApp/Views/Playback/PlaybackChromeView.swift` + `PlaybackView.swift` + `ContentView.swift`** — thread the new publisher + `isLocalFileSession` flag through.

**Tests.**

- **`PhospheneAppTests/AlbumArtworkCacheTests.swift` (new)** — 6 tests: large-source downsize cap, small-source pass-through, cache-hit returns same instance, distinct keys don't collide, malformed bytes nil, empty bytes nil. Stand-alone via synthesised PNG fixtures.
- **`PhospheneAppTests/PlaybackChromeArtworkBindingTests.swift` (new)** — 5 tests covering the `CombineLatest` binding: bytes populate display, nil leaves display nil, track advance updates both fields, art-having → art-free advance clears artwork, nil track collapses display even when artwork is non-nil.

LF.5's persistent-cache round-trip is already covered by `PersistentStemCacheTests` ("Roundtrip with artwork persists sibling bytes" + 4 related); L1's `LocalFilePrepResult.artworkData` plumbing is a struct field that flows through unchanged.

**Pre-flight decisions** (sign-off at kickoff, documented in D-133): (a) streaming-path artwork deferred to `LF.6.streaming`; (b) cornered-thumbnail visual treatment over stacked or full-bleed; (c) `albumArtData: Data?` replaces the unused `albumArtURL: URL?` TODO field; (d) `music.note.list` SF Symbol fallback over hash-pattern sigil or hidden-slot variants.

**Verification.** Engine 1360 + 1 known pre-existing flake / App 360 / SwiftLint --strict clean / `Scripts/check_user_strings.sh` + `check_sample_rate_literals.sh` exit 0. Manual smoke pending Matt's confirmation (need a release-grade fixture with embedded art — LF.5 tempo fixtures all ship art-free per `ffprobe`).

**Docs touched.** `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` (`[dev-2026-05-28-x]`), `docs/DECISIONS.md` (D-133), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (Session Preparation LF.6 sub-bullet + Key Types note on `TrackMetadata.artworkURL`), this entry.

**Follow-up.** `LF.6.streaming` (Spotify Web API `album.images[]` capture + iTunes Search fallback + URLSession fetcher + `~/Library/Caches/` byte cache); kickoff doc already on disk at `docs/prompts/LF6STREAMING_KICKOFF.md`.

### Increment LF.5.fix.3 — Folder-pick race cluster (BUG-023 A/B/C) ✅ (2026-05-28)

Three concurrency bugs in `SessionManager.startLocalFiles` surfaced during LF.5.fix.2 manual smoke verification (session `2026-05-28T20-57-46Z`). All three were symptoms of the same upstream defect: when the user picks a second folder while the first folder's preparation is still running, the cancel-then-restart path leaves orphaned state machines and racing tasks. Multi-increment fix per CLAUDE.md §Defect Handling Protocol.

**Bug A — Cancelled prep transitioned to .ready** (`ef15d90d`). `_beginMultiFileTransition` resets `cancellationRequested = false`; the older suspended `startLocalFiles` always saw false post-await and proceeded into `_completeLocalFilesReady` with its partial cancelled result. Fix: new monotonic `localFileSessionGen: UInt64`; gen mismatch is the supersession signal.

**Bug B — Parallel preps on the same folder** (`0596b8ea`). `cancel()` skips when state is `.ended` (user Stop between picks bypassed cancellation entirely). `preparationTask = nil` at every `prepareLocalFiles` exit clobbered newer task references on out-of-order returns. Fix: `prepareLocalFiles` prefixes with `preparationTask?.cancel()` (cancellation invariant at API boundary); exit no longer nils the field; `cancelPreparation` nils explicitly.

**Bug C — Mid-track restart** (`1839d3e3`). Two `_completeLocalFilesReady` calls drove two `.ready` transitions; the second one re-fired `handleLocalFileReady` for the URL already playing → `provider.teardown` + restart from frame 0. Fix: defense-in-depth `lastStartedLocalFilePlaybackURL` marker (per Matt's kickoff decision, URL match only). Guard at handleLocalFileReady entry; commit on successful audio-router start; clear on `.preparing` + `.ended`.

**Verification.** Engine 1359/1359 ✓ (1 known MemoryReporter flake). App 160/160 ✓. New regression tests:
- `startLocalFiles_secondCall_cancelsFirstInFlight_evenAfterEndSession` (engine, Bug B).
- `startLocalFiles_supersededCall_doesNotTransitionToReady` (engine, Bug A — uses `Task.detached` stub to deterministically sequence A's resume after B).
- `HandleLocalFileReadyIdempotencyRegressionTests` (new file, app, 3 source-presence assertions for Bug C).

Manual smoke (re-run kickoff reproducer) pending Matt's confirmation: picking folder B mid-A-prep cancels A silently; folder B preps exactly once; re-pick of same folder no-ops cleanly.

**Docs touched.** `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (BUG-023 filed + resolved with three commit hashes), `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` (`[dev-2026-05-28-w]`), this entry.

### Increment LF.5.fix.2 — Five post-BUG-021 cleanups (collapsed) ✅ (2026-05-28)

Five follow-ups in the BUG-021 cluster. FU-1 / FU-2 / FU-3 surfaced in the BUG-021 verification session `2026-05-28T19-42-50Z`; FU-4 (the LF-startup cousin of FU-3) was surfaced in `2026-05-28T20-36-17Z`; FU-5 closes a second mover in the same defect surface as FU-4 — verification session `2026-05-28T21-08-33Z` showed FU-4 alone insufficient. All sub-P1 (cosmetic / minor leak / latent log-only field) — collapsed into one increment per Matt's approval at the prompt's audit step.

**FU-1 — Noisy no-op `provider.teardown` breadcrumbs** (`527b0ab2`). `LocalFilePlaybackProvider.stop()` now skips the `teardownAVFoundation` helper when the lock-protected ref snapshot is all-nil. Eliminates the `provider.teardown ENTER`/`EXIT` pair around zero work at every session start and inside every Next-press `audioRouter.start BEGIN/COMPLETE` window.

**FU-2 — Stem analyzer continues for ~1 minute after Stop** (`1877f527`). `VisualizerEngine.swift`'s `.ended` state observer now calls `self.stopStemPipeline()` (cancelling the 5 s DispatchSource timer) before stopping the audio router. Pre-fix: 12 stem separations / ~60-120 s of CPU work persisted post-Stop in the verification session.

**FU-3 — `elapsedTrackTime` session-monotonic across LF track changes** (`d09a059a`). `advanceLocalFileQueue` in `VisualizerEngine+LocalFilePlayback.swift` now fires `mirPipeline.reset()` + `pipeline.resetAccumulatedAudioTime()` between `audioRouter.stop` and `resetStemPipeline(...)`, mirroring the streaming track-change callback. Audit revealed the bug surface was broader than the kickoff described — `mir.elapsedSeconds` was wrong-shaped for every LF consumer (FFO cold-start fix `fv.trackElapsedS`, `featureStability` ramp curve, recording `playbackTime`), not just the orchestrator log line. Matt approved the audit-recommended Path B (root-cause fix, smaller diff) over the prompt's prescribed Path A (new `trackChangeTimestamp` field bound only to the log line).

**FU-4 — `elapsedTrackTime` carries session-prep accumulation into LF playback start** (`9f83c471`, partial). Same field as FU-3, different code site. Session `2026-05-28T20-36-17Z` showed the first `Orchestrator: wire active` line emitting `elapsedTrackTime=440.1s` 3 s into actual playback — `MIRPipeline.elapsedSeconds` had been `+= deltaTime`-ing since `MIRPipeline()` was instantiated at session-prep entry. Two-line insert in `handleLocalFileReady` placed `mirPipeline.reset()` + `pipeline.resetAccumulatedAudioTime()` immediately before `audioRouter.start(...)`, mirroring FU-3's placement. **Partial fix** — verification session `2026-05-28T21-08-33Z` showed `elapsedTrackTime=94.3s` (still wrong). Diagnosis surfaced a second mover handled by FU-5.

**FU-5 — `lastAnalysisTime` reset on LF startup (closes FU-4's second mover)** (this commit). `VisualizerEngine.lastAnalysisTime` is initialized at `setupAudioRouting` time and only updated inside `processAnalysisFrame`. With a 91 s prep window before the first audio frame post-`audioRouter.start`, the first frame's `dt = now - lastAnalysisTime ≈ 91 s` flows into `mir.process(deltaTime:)` and re-adds the prep gap on a SINGLE frame, immediately after FU-4's `mirPipeline.reset()` zeroed `elapsedSeconds`. The 94.3 s the verification session reported = 91 s single-frame dt + 3 s real playback. One-line addition (`lastAnalysisTime = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()`) alongside the FU-4 resets closes the second mover. FU-3 (advance) didn't expose this because audio was flowing right up to `audioRouter.stop()` — `lastAnalysisTime` was already recent.

**Verification.** Engine 1358/1358 ✓ at FU-3 closeout (`[dev-2026-05-28-t]`); FU-4 + FU-5 each re-ran the targeted scope (52/52 then 41/41 ✓ on MIRPipeline + SessionManagerLocalFile + AudioInputRouterSignalState). App build clean for FU-4 and FU-5. App suite flakes pre-existing at FU-3 closeout (SessionManagerTests / AppleMusicConnectionViewModelTests timing flakes; `AccessibilityLabelsTests.connectorTileLabelDisabledNoCaption` reproduces on clean HEAD, spawned as follow-up task during closeout). SwiftLint `--strict` clean. Manual smoke pending Matt's confirmation per kickoff's done-when gate: first `Orchestrator: wire active` line on track 1 of a fresh LF session should report `elapsedTrackTime` near 0, not the session-prep duration.

**Docs touched.** `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (BUG-021 outstanding-work — FU-1/2/3 close 3 of 5 items at FU-3 closeout; FU-4 strike-through rewritten to reflect FU-5 as actual closer; the buildPlan-deferred item and the plan-walker root-cause investigation remain open), `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` (`[dev-2026-05-28-t]` for FU-1/2/3; `[dev-2026-05-28-u]` for FU-4 partial-fix narrative; `[dev-2026-05-28-v]` for FU-5 closer), this entry.

### Increment LF.5 — Multi-File Local Playback + File-Association + Recents ✅ (2026-05-28)

Lifts local-file playback from LF.4's single-file ceiling. The user picks a folder, drags multiple files, opens a `.m3u` playlist, or double-clicks an `.m4a` in Finder — and Phosphene queues the audio files in order, walks through them with the same orchestrator-driven preset selection per track that the streaming path uses, surfaces a `File → Open Recent ▸` submenu of the last 10 opens, and persists ID3 / Vorbis title / artist / album / artwork alongside each cached entry. Mid-session track transitions are hard cuts; single-file env-var hook continues to loop the file for the dev workflow.

**Landed changes:**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/SessionTypes.swift`** — `SessionOrigin` enum extends with `.localFiles([URL])` (multi-file drag), `.localFolder(URL, expanded: [URL])` (folder pick), `.localPlaylist(URL, expanded: [URL])` (M3U file). New `allLocalFileURLs` accessor returns the expanded queue for any LF origin; `localFileURL` returns the first / current head; `isLocalFile` recognises every multi-file shape.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/SessionManager.swift`** — new primary API `startLocalFiles(at:origin:)` walks the URL list via the `LocalFilePreparing` delegate, populates `preparingTracks` with placeholder identities (one per URL), publishes `trackStatuses` through `SessionPreparer`, transitions `.preparing → .ready` on completion. LF.4's `startLocalFile(at:)` is now a thin wrapper around `startLocalFiles(at: [url], origin: .localFile(url))`. Same-origin re-entry is a no-op; cancellation honoured at file boundaries.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/SessionPreparer.swift`** — new `prepareLocalFiles(urls:placeholders:via:)` method mirrors the streaming-path `prepare(tracks:)` shape but takes URLs + a `LocalFilePreparing` delegate. Publishes `trackStatuses` transitions keyed on placeholder identities so `PreparationProgressView` renders correctly. Cancellation honoured at file boundaries via the existing `preparationTask` cancellation handler. File gets a `file_length` SwiftLint disable (consistent with `SessionManager.swift`'s precedent).
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/M3UParser.swift`** (new) — defensive `.m3u` / `.m3u8` parser. Tolerates BOM, CRLF + LF line endings, `#EXTM3U` / `#EXTINF` comment lines, absolute paths, `file://` URLs, relative paths resolved against the M3U file's parent dir. Returns `ParseResult { urls, skippedLines }` so callers log `STEM_QUEUE_SKIP` per skip without the parser growing a SessionRecorder dependency. Three throw conditions: `fileUnreadable`, `malformedUTF8`, `noEntriesResolved`.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/PreviewAudio+Metadata.swift`** (new) — `LocalFileMetadata` struct + async `PreviewAudio.extractMetadata(at:)` / `extractArtwork(at:)` helpers via `AVAsset.commonMetadata`. Uniform API across ID3v2 (MP3), MP4 atoms (M4A / AAC), and Vorbis comments (FLAC). All failures return nil per-field — metadata is a nice-to-have surface, never load-bearing.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/PersistentStemCache.swift`** — schema bumped to v2 with optional `metadata: LocalFileMetadata?` field in `metadata.json` + optional sibling `artwork.bin` (raw PNG / JPEG bytes from the source). `PersistentStemCacheEntry` carries the new fields. Schema-v1 entries on disk throw `schemaMismatch` → caller re-prepares with v2. Overwrite-without-artwork removes any stale sibling so post-load reads don't surface mismatched art.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/LocalFilePlaybackProvider.swift`** — new `onFileEnded: @Sendable () -> Void` callback. When set, `scheduleFileLoop` invokes it INSTEAD of re-scheduling the file (LF.5 multi-file advance). When nil (LF.1 / LF.4 / single-file default), the file loops forever — preserves the dev-workflow env-var hook behaviour per Matt's audit answer.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/AudioInputRouter.swift`** — new `onLocalFilePlaybackEnded: @Sendable () -> Void` field. Relayed into the freshly-constructed `LocalFilePlaybackProvider.onFileEnded` at `start(mode: .localFilePlayback)` time. Engine consumers re-bind on every per-track restart.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+LocalFilePlayback.swift`** — `runLocalFilePreparation` now extracts metadata + artwork before `analyzePreview`, persists both via the new schema-v2 cache, and builds an enriched `TrackIdentity` (title / artist / album from metadata, filename / "local file" fallback). On cache hit, reconstructs the same enriched identity from cached metadata. New `advanceLocalFileQueue()` method pops the next URL + identity from `currentSource` + `currentPlan`, stops the current audio router, installs the next BeatGrid via `resetStemPipeline(caller: .trackChange)`, restarts the router, bumps `currentTrackIndex`. Queue exhaustion → `sessionManager.endSession()`. `handleLocalFileReady` wires `onLocalFilePlaybackEnded` for multi-file sessions only; single-file sessions leave it nil so the LF.1 loop default fires.
- **`PhospheneApp/LocalFileRecentsStore.swift`** (new) — observable app-layer Recents store. Persists last 10 opens (`kind ∈ {file, folder, m3u}`) as JSON in `phosphene.lf.recents` UserDefaults. LRU-style move-to-front; defensive load truncates oversized persisted state. `RecentItem.isMissing` surfaces stale entries for the menu.
- **`PhospheneApp/LocalFileMenuCommands.swift`** — six entry-point shapes: `openLocalFilePanel` (LF.4 widened with recentsStore), `openLocalFolderPanel` (LF.5 new), `openLocalFile / openLocalFolder / openLocalM3U` (programmatic re-entry for Recents submenu + file-association), `handleDrop` (LF.4 widened — multi-file / folder / M3U / mixed drops). Per Matt's audit, folder + multi-drop queues truncate at 200 URLs (localized alert + queued first 200 alphabetical).
- **`PhospheneApp/LocalFileMenuCommands+Drop.swift`** (new) — split from `LocalFileMenuCommands.swift` to satisfy file_length + type_body_length caps. Houses the multi-provider drop entry point + the `@MainActor`-isolated `DropCollector` that batches asynchronous `NSItemProvider.loadItem` callbacks before dispatching. Swift 6 strict-concurrency: `NSItemProvider` never crosses an actor boundary; only Sendable URLs cross via per-callback `Task`.
- **`PhospheneApp/PhospheneApp.swift`** — `File → Open Local Folder…` menu item (no accelerator), `File → Open Recent ▸` reactive submenu (last 10 entries, "(missing)" for stale, `Clear Recents` at bottom). `.onOpenURL` extended to distinguish `phosphene://` (Spotify OAuth, U.11) from `file://` (LF.5 file-association). LocalFileRecentsStore wired as `@StateObject` and passed to every dispatch path.
- **`PhospheneApp/Info.plist`** — `CFBundleDocumentTypes` registers Phosphene as an Alternate handler (NOT Default) for `m4a / mp3 / flac / m3u / m3u8`. `LSHandlerRank=Alternate` so the user opts in via Finder's "Open With…" menu rather than Phosphene hijacking the system defaults.
- **`PhospheneApp/en.lproj/Localizable.strings`** — 7 new strings: `menu.file.open_local_folder`, `menu.file.open_recent` (+ `.empty` / `.missing_suffix` / `.clear`), `lf.open.folder.panel.title`, `lf.open.error.empty_folder`, `lf.open.error.m3u_parse_failed`, `lf.queue.truncation.title` + `.body`.
- **`PhospheneApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`** — 4-section entries for the three new app-layer files (Q10003/Q20003 `LocalFileRecentsStore.swift`, Q10004/Q20004 `LocalFileMenuCommands+Drop.swift`, L10043/L20043 `LocalFileRecentsStoreTests.swift`).

**Tests:**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Session/SessionManagerLocalFileTests.swift`** — 14 LF.4 + 13 LF.5 lifecycle + 2 LF.5 per-track-status observer = **29 tests**.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Session/M3UParserTests.swift`** (new, 9 tests) — trivial 3-track, #EXTINF ignored, relative-path resolution, BOM + CRLF tolerance, skip-unreadable, noEntriesResolved, fileUnreadable, file:// URL form, malformed UTF-8.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Session/PersistentStemCacheTests.swift`** — 11 LF.3/LF.4 + 5 LF.5 metadata + artwork roundtrip = **16 tests**.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Audio/LocalFilePlaybackFormatCoverageTests.swift`** — 3 per-format + 1 LF.5 queue test (3-fixture folder through `prepareLocalFiles`) = **4 tests**.
- **`PhospheneAppTests/LocalFileRecentsStoreTests.swift`** (new, 12 tests) — init / addOrPromote / LRU / cap / per-kind identity / remove / clearAll / persistence roundtrip / oversized-load truncation / isMissing / displayLabel.

**Diagnostic capture:**

- **`docs/diagnostics/LF5_REGRESSION_2026-05-28.md`** (new) — Cold/warm latency capture on `love_rehab.m4a` through the LF.5 `SessionManager.startLocalFiles` path. Confirms no regression past LF.4's baseline (~2 s cold, ≤ 1 s warm).

**Documentation updates:**

- **`docs/DECISIONS.md`** — new D-132 (LF.5 multi-file source model + sequential preparation + recents persistence + file-association + schema v2). D-131's Out-of-scope updated.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — §Session Preparation extended with the multi-file LF path; §Session Manager extended with the LF.5 queue model.
- **`docs/UX_SPEC.md`** — §2.1 extended with multi-file entry points + Recents submenu + file-association behavior.
- **`docs/RUNBOOK.md`** — Local-file recents inspection + clear command; M3U parsing notes; truncation behavior at the 200-file cap.
- **`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md`** — `[dev-2026-05-28-a]` entry.

**Out of scope (deferred):**

- Crossfade / gapless segue between LF tracks (hard cuts at LF.5).
- Album-art display in `PlaybackView` (data captured at LF.5; UI is LF.6).
- Per-track skip / next / prev controls in `PlaybackView` (UX-2 invariant).
- Drag-to-reorder of the queue mid-session.
- Manual track removal from the queue.
- Smart-playlists / Apple Music library bundle ingestion / Spotify-local-file integration.
- `.fpl` (Foobar2000) playlist files.
- In-app M3U editor / "Save current queue as M3U" export.
- Streaming-path persistent cache (different cache-key shape + invalidation surface).
- Spotify track-ID-keyed cache.
- Multi-file env-var hook (`PHOSPHENE_LOCAL_FILES_PLAYBACK` — current env var stays single-file).
- "Real title in PreparationProgressView" during the per-file analyze window (filename surfaces during prep; metadata-derived title surfaces in `PlaybackView` post-prep — UI polish if Matt wants it).
- Cross-machine library sync (iCloud Music Library / iTunes Match).
- Network-streamed files (HTTP / SoundCloud).

**Verification.**

- LF.1 regression gate green: `swift test --filter AudioInputRouterSignalStateTests` (11/11).
- LF format-coverage gate green: `LF_FORMAT_COVERAGE=1 swift test --filter LocalFilePlaybackFormatCoverageTests` (4/4 — incl. LF.5 3-fixture queue).
- LF cache gates green: `PersistentStemCacheTests` (16/16) + `PersistentStemCacheEvictionTests` (11/11) + `PreviewAudioContentHashTests` (8/8).
- LF lifecycle gates green: `SessionManagerLocalFileTests` (29/29) + `M3UParserTests` (9/9) + `LocalFileRecentsStoreTests` (12/12).
- Soak tests green: `SOAK_TESTS=1 swift test --filter SoakTestHarness` (7/7, 315 s).
- Full engine suite green: 1358 tests / 172 suites (LF.4 baseline was 1328 — +30 net new LF.5 tests).
- Sample-rate literal gate green: `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` exit 0.
- Localized-strings gate green: `Scripts/check_user_strings.sh` exit 0.
- Release build green: `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -configuration Release build` exit 0.
- Live cold/warm capture matches LF.4 baseline. See `docs/diagnostics/LF5_REGRESSION_2026-05-28.md`.

**Known risks and follow-ups.**

- **Multi-file env-var hook not implemented** (single-file env var stays for dev). Manual UI smoke is the only automated-gap for the multi-file audio-router + EOF advance dimension; 27 unit tests cover the SessionManager + SessionPreparer lifecycle through stubs.
- **Cache invalidation on schema bump.** LF.4 user caches throw `schemaMismatch` on next read → re-prepare. One-time ~2 s cost per cached track; LF.4 user caches were small (1-3 entries).
- **LocalFile metadata in PreparationProgressView** still shows filename during the per-file analyze window; the metadata-derived title surfaces in PlaybackView post-prep. The list rows would show real titles if the placeholder identity were updated mid-prep; deferred because it requires `trackStatuses` dict re-keying. Acceptable for LF.5 — the window is ~2 s per file, then PlaybackView mounts with the real identity.
- **Mid-session orchestrator preset selection.** `resetStemPipeline(caller: .trackChange)` in `advanceLocalFileQueue` matches the streaming-path call, so the orchestrator's per-track preset selection logic runs in the same shape. Manual smoke verification recommended (3-track folder → confirm preset changes between tracks).
- **Folder + multi-drop cap at 200.** Larger folders truncate with a localized NSAlert. The cache's 500 MB cap (~70 tracks) means a 200-track queue thrashes eviction mid-queue; the first 30 tracks may need to re-prepare on revisit. Accepted by Matt at the audit.
- **LF.4 `Phosphene → Clear Local-File Cache (<size>)` size-label stale-while-open** (LF.4 known risk) — unchanged at LF.5.

**Recommended next increment.** LF.6 — album-art display in `PlaybackView` chrome (data already captured at LF.5 via the `artwork.bin` sibling; UI surface needed). OR a multi-file env-var hook for the dev workflow. OR a `PHOSPHENE_LOCAL_FILE_REPLAYABLE_SCRUB=1` toggle for replay-debugging the LF.5 mid-session advance against recorded sessions.

### Increment CSP.4 — Volumetric Lithograph audit: no antipatterns; doc-only refresh ✅ (2026-05-28)

Audit follow-up after BUG-019's close. The `[dev-2026-05-28-i]` close noted that the same continuous-bass primary pattern that fixed FFO might extend to VL's terrain pulse + camera dolly. The investigation found VL is structurally clean of all three FFO antipatterns:

- **Deviation-primitive dead zone (FFO CSP.3.2):** VL's depth driver is `stems.vocals_energy` (AGC stem, measured mean 0.33–0.36 in steady state) — not a deviation primitive. The warmup-fallback `f.mid_att_rel` IS a deviation primitive but is only consumed for ~10 s before stems arrive. Per-stem `_energy_dev` primitives (the FFO-CSP.3.2 root cause, mean ≈ 0 post-SAR.1) are not consumed anywhere in VL.
- **Beat-dominant lighting (PERF.3):** Already fixed in `applyAudioModulation` at engine level; VL inherits automatically.
- **SDF Lipschitz overshoot (FFO CSP.3.4):** `VL_SDF_STEP_SCALE = 0.6` (effective divisor 1.67) is well-sized for VL's broader low-frequency noise (`VL_NOISE_FREQUENCY = 0.12`); no overshoot artifacts reported in `2026-05-28T17-16-36Z` M7.
- **Camera dolly:** Already on Layer-1-primary shape: `baseSpeed × (0.5 + features.bass × 1.1)`, identical to FFO's post-CSP.3.2 formula.

The shader docstring at the top of `VolumetricLithograph.metal` describes v6/v7 routing (coactivation + density + attack) that v9.3 removed; the JSON sidecar `description` cites the same stale v6 narrative. This commit refreshes both to reflect the actual v9.4 routing. **No shader logic, no constant, no behaviour change.**

**Done-when.**

- [x] Engine: swift test unchanged (no logic touched). `PresetRegressionTests` golden hashes unaffected.
- [x] App build: succeeds.
- [x] SwiftLint `--strict`: clean on `VolumetricLithograph.metal`.
- [x] **Matt M7 (optional sanity check).** Doc-only commits do not normally need an M7 gate.

### Increment LF.4 — Local-File Playback as a User-Facing Feature ✅ (2026-05-27)

Lifts local-file playback from the LF.3 `PHOSPHENE_LOCAL_FILE_PLAYBACK` env-var hook to a first-class user-facing feature on the macOS app surface. The user clicks `File → Open Local File…` (⌘O) — or drags an audio file onto the app window — and the file plays through Phosphene with the same `idle → preparing → ready → playing` state machine the streaming path uses. Cache hygiene moves from "operator deletes `~/Library/Application Support/Phosphene/StemCache/` by hand" to an automatic LRU eviction policy (default 500 MB cap ≈ 70 cached tracks) plus a `Phosphene → Clear Local-File Cache (<size>)` menu item showing the current footprint.

**Landed changes:**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/SessionTypes.swift`** — new `SessionOrigin` enum (`.playlist(PlaylistSource) / .localFile(URL)`) with `isLocalFile` / `localFileURL` accessors. Consumers stop tracking parallel booleans for "is this a local-file session"; they read `sessionManager.currentSource?.isLocalFile`.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/LocalFilePreparing.swift`** (new) — protocol that `SessionManager.startLocalFile(at:)` delegates the hash + persistent-cache + analyze + persist pipeline to. `VisualizerEngine` conforms (Task 2) and the protocol keeps SessionManager from importing StemSeparator / PersistentStemCache / MoodClassifier / BeatGridAnalyzer.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/SessionManager.swift`** — new `startLocalFile(at:)` API. Hashes off-main via the preparer delegate, transitions through `.preparing` → `.ready` (engine reacts to install BeatGrid + start audio + advance to `.playing`). Same-URL re-entry is a no-op; different-URL or active streaming session is silently replaced via `cancel()`. `progressiveReadinessLevel` jumps `.preparing → .fullyPrepared` via the existing `computeReadiness` "all terminal, one ready" branch. `cancel()` / `endSession()` clear `currentSource` + `currentPlan`. A placeholder identity in `preparingTracks` keeps `PreparationProgressView` from rendering its empty-state during the ~2 s `analyzePreview` window.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/PersistentStemCache.swift`** — new `totalBytes() -> Int64`, `evictToMaxBytes(_:) -> Int`, `clearAll() -> Int64`. `store(...)` calls `evictToMaxBytes(configuredMaxBytes())` after every successful write. Eviction order is mtime-ascending (oldest first). New `maxBytes:` init parameter for tests + future settings UI. New static `defaultMaxBytes: Int64 = 500 MB` + `maxBytesUserDefaultsKey = "phosphene.cache.localFile.maxBytes"`.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+LocalFilePlayback.swift`** (new) — `LocalFilePreparing` conformance + `.ready` observer (`handleLocalFileReady()` installs cached BeatGrid via `resetStemPipeline`, starts the LF audio router, advances to `.playing` via `beginPlayback()`). Off-main worker (`runLocalFilePreparation`) carries the LF.3 hash + cache + analyze + persist logic verbatim — only the entry point shape changes.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+PublicAPI.swift`** — LF.1 / LF.2 / LF.3 entry points removed (`startLocalFilePlayback(url:)`, `prepareAndStartLocalFilePlayback(url:)`, `_completeLocalFilePlaybackStart(url:tag:)`). `startAudio()` now annotates `@MainActor` and reads `sessionManager.currentSource?.isLocalFile`. File shrinks below the 400-line `file_length` warning so the disable comment is gone too.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift`** — `localFilePlaybackActive` field removed. New `@Published var localFileCacheBytes: Int64` publisher + `refreshLocalFileCacheBytes()` method drive the menu cache-size label. Primed at engine init; refreshed inside `handleLocalFileReady()`. Wires `sessionManager.localFilePreparer = self` post-init. The `.ready` Combine observer dispatches LF vs streaming (`buildPlan()` for streaming; `handleLocalFileReady()` for LF).
- **`PhospheneApp/LocalFileMenuCommands.swift`** (new) — glue between the SwiftUI Commands block / `.onDrop` modifier and `SessionManager.startLocalFile(at:)`. Owns the `NSOpenPanel` for the menu picker, the drop-provider URL resolution, the extension validation pass (`.m4a` / `.mp3` / `.flac`), the cache-clear action, and the localized alert presentation. Resolves drag-and-drop URLs on the `loadItem` completion queue (not the Task hop) to satisfy Swift 6 strict-concurrency.
- **`PhospheneApp/PhospheneApp.swift`** — `.commands { CommandGroup(replacing: .newItem) { … } CommandGroup(after: .appInfo) { … } }` adds `File → Open Local File…` (⌘O) and `Phosphene → Clear Local-File Cache (<size>)`. `.onDrop(of: [.fileURL])` accepts a single audio file. Env-var hook now routes through `engine.sessionManager.startLocalFile(at:)` so the dev workflow keeps working with no behaviour change.
- **`PhospheneApp/ContentView.swift`** — permission gate now reads `engine.sessionManager.currentSource?.isLocalFile`. LF `.ready` routes directly to `PlaybackView` (no `ReadyView` flash during the cross-state transition).
- **`PhospheneApp/en.lproj/Localizable.strings`** — new strings for `menu.file.open_local_file`, `menu.app.clear_local_file_cache`, the `NSOpenPanel` title, the unsupported-format / multiple-files / unreadable alerts, the cache-cleared confirmation, and the LF preparation copy stubs.
- **`PhospheneApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`** — 4-section entries for the two new app-layer files (`Q10001/Q20001` for `VisualizerEngine+LocalFilePlayback.swift`; `Q10002/Q20002` for `LocalFileMenuCommands.swift`).

**Tests:**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Session/SessionManagerLocalFileTests.swift`** (new, 14 tests) — state-machine transitions, cache store under synthetic identity, progressive-readiness short-circuit, same-URL no-op, different-URL replace, no-preparer / preparer-returns-nil degradation, cancel + endSession source clearing.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Session/PersistentStemCacheEvictionTests.swift`** (new, 11 tests) — `totalBytes()` accuracy, `evictToMaxBytes()` boundary cases (cap=0 / cap=Int64.max / cap=midpoint), mtime ordering (touched entry survives), `clearAll()` on populated and empty caches, `store()` with injected cap triggers auto-eviction.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Audio/LocalFilePlaybackFormatCoverageTests.swift`** (modified) — each per-format test (M4A/AAC, MP3, FLAC) now exercises the `PersistentStemCache` roundtrip (`store → load → equal-fields`). Catches format-specific Codable serialization issues that the M4A-only LF.3 PersistentStemCacheTests would have missed.

**Diagnostic capture:**

- **`docs/diagnostics/LF4_REGRESSION_2026-05-27.md`** (new) — Cold/warm latency re-capture on `love_rehab.m4a` through the new SessionManager-driven path. Confirms no regression past LF.3's baseline.

**Documentation updates:**

- **`docs/DECISIONS.md`** — new D-131 (SessionManager LF source model + LRU eviction policy + cache-clear UX). D-130's Out-of-scope updated — "cache eviction policy / size bounds (LF.4)" and "cache-clear UI / cache-stats display (LF.4)" struck through as Done.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — §Session Preparation step 3 LF sub-bullet extended for the SessionManager-owned lifecycle; §Session Manager state machine adds the LF source path.
- **`docs/UX_SPEC.md`** — new sub-section under §3 for the LF entry point + the `.preparing` state mapping for local files.
- **`docs/RUNBOOK.md`** — Local-file stem cache management subsection updated for the menu item + automatic eviction policy.
- **`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md`** — `[dev-2026-05-27-d]` entry.

**Out of scope (deferred):**

- Multi-file playlist semantics (folder ingestion / M3U / `.fpl`). LF.5.
- Crossfade / gapless segue. LF.5.
- ID3 / Vorbis tag extraction; album-art display. LF.5.
- "Recent Files" submenu. LF.5.
- Settings UI for the cache-size cap (UserDefaults override only at LF.4 scope).
- Per-track cache invalidation UI.
- Streaming-path persistent cache (Spotify track ID → cached analysis surviving app restart). Different cache-key shape and invalidation surface.
- File-association handling (double-click `.m4a` in Finder → opens Phosphene). LF.5.
- Mid-track resumption on `AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange` (still best-effort from beginning).
- Multi-process cache safety (Phosphene is single-instance).
- Production telemetry / cache hit-rate dashboards.
- Generalising the LF source to network streams (HTTP / SoundCloud / etc.).

**Verification.**

- LF.1 regression gate green: `swift test --filter AudioInputRouterSignalStateTests` (11/11).
- LF.2 format-coverage gate green: `LF_FORMAT_COVERAGE=1 swift test --filter LocalFilePlaybackFormatCoverageTests` (3/3 — now with persist-roundtrip).
- LF.3 + LF.4 cache tests green: `PersistentStemCacheTests` (11/11) + `PersistentStemCacheEvictionTests` (11/11) + `PreviewAudioContentHashTests` (8/8).
- LF.4 lifecycle tests green: `SessionManagerLocalFileTests` (14/14).
- Soak tests green: `SOAK_TESTS=1 swift test --filter SoakTestHarness` (7/7, 315 s).
- Sample-rate literal gate green: `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` exit 0.
- Localized-strings gate green: `Scripts/check_user_strings.sh` exit 0.
- Release build green: `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -configuration Release build` exit 0.
- Live cold/warm capture matches LF.3 baseline. See `docs/diagnostics/LF4_REGRESSION_2026-05-27.md`.

**Known risks and follow-ups.**

- Cancel UX during the ~2 s `analyzePreview` window honours `cancellationRequested` only after the preparer returns — the cancel button responds visually (state → .idle) but the worker can't be interrupted mid-stem-separation. Acceptable for LF.4 (the worker is < 2 s); LF.5 multi-file work may need cooperative cancellation.
- The label on the `Phosphene → Clear Local-File Cache (<size>)` menu item updates reactively via the `@Published` publisher, but SwiftUI menu items don't reactively re-render while open — the size can stale while the menu is hovered. Refreshes on next open. Acceptable.
- The `ReadyView` flash is fully suppressed for LF (ContentView routes LF `.ready` to `PlaybackView`); a streaming session that drops back to `.ready` post-`.playing` still goes through `ReadyView`.
- Drag-and-drop accepts single files only. Multi-file drops are rejected with a localized alert.
- The cache-clear menu action uses an `NSAlert` confirmation; no undo. Acceptable — the disk write of a new file restores the cache for that file in ~2 s anyway.

**Recommended next increment.** LF.5 — multi-file playlist semantics (folder ingestion, M3U files, "Recent Files" submenu, file-association handling). The LF.4 `SessionOrigin` enum was designed to extend naturally to `.localFolder([URL])`.

### Increment LF.3 — Persistent Content-Keyed Stem Cache ✅ (2026-05-27)

Closes the LF.2 follow-up Matt named at closeout: LF.2's `StemCache.store(_:for:)` was process-lifetime only, so a second launch on the same local file re-ran the full ~2 s pre-analysis even though the result would be byte-identical. LF.3 makes the cache persistent. Same file across app launches → near-instant startup (~634 ms wall vs LF.2's ~2 s, **a ~3× speedup**, well under the 500 ms cache-hit-path target). First launch on a fresh install behaves identically to LF.2 (cache miss → `analyzePreview` runs → result written to disk in 4 ms wall).

**Landed changes:**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/PersistentStemCache.swift`** (new) — Disk-backed content-keyed cache. Layout: `<root>/sha256/<aa>/<full-hash>/{metadata.json, vocals.f32, drums.f32, bass.f32, other.f32}` where `<aa>` is the first two hex chars (filesystem sharding) and `<full-hash>` is the file's SHA-256. The four `.f32` files are raw little-endian Float32 PCM (matches `[[Float]]` in memory). `metadata.json` carries `cacheSchemaVersion: 1`, the `BeatGrid` / `drumsBeatGrid` / `StemFeatures` / `TrackProfile`, `gridOnsetOffsetMs`, `stemSampleCounts`, and `decodedDuration` (so a warm-launch `TrackIdentity` carries the same `duration` value as a cold-launch one). NSLock-guarded for thread safety. Errors surface as `PersistentStemCacheError` (`rootDirectoryUnavailable`, `schemaMismatch`, `corruptMetadata`, `missingStem`, `malformedStem`) — all non-fatal; callers fall through to the LF.2 in-memory path.

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Shared/StemFeatures.swift`** (modified) — explicit `Codable` conformance with `CodingKeys` excluding the `_sfPad3...22` padding floats. On-disk format includes only the 44 load-bearing fields, robust to any future change in the 64-float GPU padding layout.

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Shared/AudioFeatures+Analyzed.swift`** (modified) — `EmotionalState` is now `Codable` (default synth on two Floats).

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/TrackProfile.swift`** (modified) — `TrackProfile` is now `Codable` (default synth — every nested field is Codable).

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/SessionTypes.swift`** (modified) — `PreviewAudio.sha256(of:)` added (CryptoKit-backed full-file SHA-256; matches `shasum -a 256` byte-for-byte). `PreviewAudio.fromLocalFile(at:contentHash:)` gains the optional `contentHash:` parameter so callers that already need the hash don't pay for two full-file reads. Synthetic identity migrated from `local:<path>` to `local:sha256:<hash>` — renamed/moved copies of the same bytes resolve to the same `TrackIdentity`.

- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift`** (modified) — new `persistentStemCache: PersistentStemCache?` field constructed at engine init under `~/Library/Application Support/Phosphene/StemCache/`. Failure to create the directory leaves the field nil and the LF path falls through to LF.2's in-memory-only flow.

- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+PublicAPI.swift`** (modified) — `prepareAndStartLocalFilePlayback(url:)` is now cache-aware. Off-main worker (`runLocalFilePreparation`) hashes the file → consults the persistent cache → on hit loads + skips analyzePreview entirely → on miss runs the LF.2 flow + persists the result. New `LocalFilePrepOutcome` value type carries an `.persistentDisk` / `.freshAnalysis` source enum for the log line. Three new wiring-log lines added matching the existing `WIRING:` / `BEAT_GRID_INSTALL:` pattern: `STEM_CACHE_HIT: source=persistentDisk, track=…, hash=<first-12>, bpm=…, beats=…`, `STEM_CACHE_MISS: source=persistentDisk, …, reason={no-entry, load-failed(…)}`, `STEM_CACHE_WROTE: source=persistentDisk, …, bytes=…, elapsedMs=…`.

**Tests:**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Session/PersistentStemCacheTests.swift`** (new, 11 tests) — Roundtrip (base + extended StemFeatures fields), missing-entry / schema-mismatch / corrupt-JSON / missing-stem / malformed-stem-byte-count all throw, overwrite replaces all four stem files (and updates `decodedDuration`), concurrent store/load fan-out is NSLock-serialized, two-byte hash-prefix sharding verified, default constructor honours explicit `rootDirectory`.

- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Session/PreviewAudioContentHashTests.swift`** (new, 8 tests) — `sha256(of:)` returns 64-char lowercase hex; stable across reads; independent of path; distinguishes content; throws on missing file; matches `shasum -a 256 love_rehab.m4a` reference output (`c1685f07d559…`); `fromLocalFile()` emits the new `local:sha256:` prefix; explicit `contentHash:` is honoured verbatim (no recompute).

- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Audio/LocalFilePlaybackFormatCoverageTests.swift`** (modified) — identity assertion updated from `local:<path>` to `local:sha256:<hash>`.

**Diagnostic capture:**

- **`docs/diagnostics/LF3_COLD_WARM_2026-05-27.md`** (new) — Cold/warm side-by-side on `love_rehab.m4a` (M2 Pro, Release build). Cold session `2026-05-27T22-00-23Z`: `STEM_CACHE_MISS` at line 3, `STEM_CACHE_WROTE bytes=7045120 elapsedMs=4` at line 4, `BeatGrid installed: source=preparedCache` at line 7, audio router at +2.408 s — matches LF.2 cold (no regression). Warm session `2026-05-27T22-00-59Z`: `STEM_CACHE_HIT` at line 3, `BeatGrid installed` at line 6, audio router at +634 ms — ~3× faster than LF.2. On-disk layout verified at 6.7 MB per track (4 × 1.76 MB stem files + 5 KB metadata.json).

**Documentation updates:**

- **`docs/DECISIONS.md`** — new D-130 (LF.3 cache layout + content-hash key + schema versioning + `local:` + path → `local:sha256:` + hash identity migration). D-129's Out-of-scope list updated — "persistent content-keyed stem cache (LF.3)" struck through as Done.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — §Session Preparation step 3 LF sub-bullet extended to mention the persistent cache layer.
- **`docs/RUNBOOK.md`** — new "Local-file stem cache management" subsection (cache location, how to clear, expected size per track).
- **`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md`** — `[dev-2026-05-27-c]` entry (LF.3 commits).

**Out of scope (deferred):**

- **Streaming-path persistence.** Spotify track ID → cached analysis surviving app restart. Different cache-key shape (metadata-derived, not content-derived), different invalidation surface (Spotify can rotate preview URLs). Design discussion is its own increment if the need surfaces.
- **Cache eviction policy / size bounds.** LF.4 territory if needed.
- **Cache-clear UI / cache-stats display.** Operator-facing cleanup is `rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Phosphene/StemCache`. Documented in RUNBOOK.
- **Folder / M3U / multi-file ingestion (LF.4).**
- **File-picker UI / settings audio-source toggle / drag-and-drop (LF.4).**
- **`SessionManager` integration (LF.4).** LF.3 stays in ad-hoc / env-var-driven flow.
- **Cross-fixture cache verification across multiple tracks.** Single-fixture verification was sufficient for LF.3 done-when.
- **StemSeparator tiling / Beat This! sliding-window aggregation.** LF.2's "full-track" framing was structurally aspirational; LF.3 inherits the same 10 s / 30 s windows (the cached data IS the first 10 s of stems + 30 s of beats).
- **Multi-process cache safety** (two PhospheneApp instances launching the same file simultaneously). Phosphene is a single-instance app.

**Verification.**

- LF.1 regression gate green: `swift test --filter AudioInputRouterSignalStateTests` (11/11).
- LF.2 format-coverage gate green: `LF_FORMAT_COVERAGE=1 swift test --filter LocalFilePlaybackFormatCoverageTests` (3/3 — M4A, MP3, FLAC).
- New LF.3 tests green: `swift test --filter PersistentStemCacheTests` (11/11) + `swift test --filter PreviewAudioContentHash` (8/8).
- Sample-rate literal gate green: `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` exit 0 (the new code reads `tapSampleRate`, `preview.sampleRate`, and the persisted `decodedDuration` — no `44100` literals introduced).
- Release build: `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' -configuration Release build` exit 0.
- Live cold/warm capture: see `docs/diagnostics/LF3_COLD_WARM_2026-05-27.md`.

**Known risks and follow-ups:**

- Single-fixture verification (love_rehab.m4a). Cross-track behaviour is LF.3+ if needed.
- Hash-on-every-launch is a fixed ~30 ms tax for typical AAC; ~200 ms for 50 MB lossless. Hash-against-(inode,mtime,size) is a possible future shortcut but adds invalidation surface — currently a non-issue.
- No production telemetry / cache hit-rate dashboards.
- Cache-corruption recovery is automatic (`STEM_CACHE_MISS: reason=load-failed`) but not surfaced anywhere user-visible. LF.4+.

**Recommended next increment.** LF.4 — file picker / drag-and-drop UI + `SessionManager` integration. The LF arc has been infrastructure-first; with LF.3 closed, the next move is to lift LF from the `PHOSPHENE_LOCAL_FILE_PLAYBACK` env-var hook to a user-facing feature. Cache eviction policy and per-file cache-stats fall out naturally from that work.

### Increment LF.2 — Full-Track Offline Pre-Analysis ✅ (2026-05-27)

Closes the structural gap LF.1 left behind: when a local file is played via `PHOSPHENE_LOCAL_FILE_PLAYBACK`, the live `BeatGrid` was installed by the live Beat This! analyzer ~10 s into the track after AGC convergence (LF.1 baseline session `2026-05-27T19-44-25Z` shows `source=liveAnalysis` at log line 8, after `signal quality → green`). LF.2 runs `SessionPreparer.analyzePreview` on the file PCM BEFORE the audio router starts, installs the cached `BeatGrid` + `StemFeatures` into the live pipeline via `resetStemPipeline(for:caller:)`, then starts audio. The cached BeatGrid is installed at session start (log line 5 in the LF.2 capture, BEFORE `raw tap capture started`).

**Landed changes:**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/SessionPreparer+Analysis.swift`** — `analyzePreview(...)` visibility raised from `internal` to `public`. The function is already designed as a self-contained pure function (nonisolated, static, no captures); exposing it lets the App-layer LF.2 entry point drive pre-analysis directly without going through the full `SessionPreparer.prepare(tracks:)` orchestration (LF.2 is single-file + ad-hoc, no playlist, no preview-resolver / downloader). Doc-comment updated to reference the new caller.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/SessionTypes.swift`** — new `public static func PreviewAudio.fromLocalFile(at: URL) throws -> PreviewAudio`. Decodes a local audio file to mono Float32 PCM via `AVAudioFile` (stereo+ averaged). Builds a synthetic `TrackIdentity` with `spotifyID = "local:" + url.path` so cache lookups don't collide with any real catalog track. New `public enum LocalFileDecodeError` for `emptyFile` / `bufferAllocationFailed` / `emptyDecodedBuffer` failure modes. `AVFoundation` import added.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+PublicAPI.swift`** — new `@MainActor func prepareAndStartLocalFilePlayback(url: URL) async`. Flips `localFilePlaybackActive = true` synchronously (so ContentView's permission gate bypasses immediately), runs `analyzePreview` inside `Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated)`, stores the result in `stemCache` with the synthetic identity, calls `resetStemPipeline(for: identity, caller: .other)` to install BeatGrid + cached stems, then calls the shared `_completeLocalFilePlaybackStart(url:tag:)` helper to start the audio router + stem pipeline + ad-hoc session. Falls through to the LF.1 behaviour on any pre-analysis failure (missing weights, decode error, etc.) — log warning + continue without cached install. The existing `startLocalFilePlayback(url:)` LF.1 method now also routes through `_completeLocalFilePlaybackStart` to keep the audio-router-start sequence in one place. Eager-init of `liveBeatGridAnalyzer` added inside the new method — the analyzer was lazy-initialised at first live-inference call; LF.2 needs it ready before audio starts. Same instance is then re-used by live inference once audio is flowing.
- **`PhospheneApp/PhospheneApp.swift`** — env-var hook task updated to `await engine.prepareAndStartLocalFilePlayback(url: url)` (was `engine.startLocalFilePlayback(url: url)`). Log tag updated to `[LF.2]`.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Audio/LocalFilePlaybackFormatCoverageTests.swift`** (new) — opt-in suite gated by `LF_FORMAT_COVERAGE=1`. Three tests (M4A/AAC, MP3, FLAC), each: decodes via `PreviewAudio.fromLocalFile(at:)`, sanity-checks sample rate / duration / synthetic identity, runs `SessionPreparer.analyzePreview` with real ML deps (`StemSeparator`, `StemAnalyzer`, `MoodClassifier`, `DefaultBeatGridAnalyzer`), asserts non-empty BeatGrid (BPM > 0, range [110, 130] for Love Rehab) and finite per-stem energies. Fixture-absent uses `Issue.record(...)` per CLAUDE.md rule.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/Fixtures/tempo/love_rehab.mp3`** (new, .gitignore'd) — transcoded from `love_rehab.m4a` via `ffmpeg -codec:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k`. 720 KB.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/Fixtures/tempo/love_rehab.flac`** (new, .gitignore'd) — transcoded from `love_rehab.m4a` via `afconvert -f flac -d flac`. 5.68 MB.
- **`docs/diagnostics/LF2_BEFORE_AFTER_2026-05-27.md`** (new) — full before/after report. Session-log diff confirming the BeatGrid-install timing change (line 8 source=liveAnalysis → line 5 source=preparedCache). Frame-0 feature availability table (all four stem energies + grid_bpm now populated from frame 4). Pre-analysis startup latency (~2 s on M2 Pro). Metrics-preservation table from `Scripts/lf1_5_ab_compare.py` (BPM Δ = 0.55 BPM ✅, all energy / mood deltas within tolerance). Known risks: comparison script's "LF vs Process-Tap" framing is now stale when read as before/after; single-fixture verification; full-track analysis still aspirational at LF.2 scope.
- **`docs/DECISIONS.md`** — new D-129 (LF.2 dispatch model: blocking pre-analysis, in-memory cache only). D-128 Out-of-scope list updated — LF.2's two LF.1-deferred items (stem separation pre-analysis of the full track; format-coverage testing) struck through as Done.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — §Session Preparation gets a new sub-bullet under step 3 noting the LF.2 path bypasses preview download and runs `analyzePreview` on the file PCM directly.
- **`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md`** — `[dev-2026-05-27-g]` entry.

**Empirical findings during the audit (surfaced to Matt before scoping):**

- **`StemSeparator.separate(...)` silently truncates to ~10 s** (`requiredMonoSamples = 440320` at 44.1 kHz). Open-Unmix HQ MPSGraph has a fixed window; no tiling.
- **`BeatThisModel.predictCore(...)` clamps to ~30 s** (`tMax = 1500` frames at 50 fps).

The prompt's "full-track" framing is therefore structurally aspirational. The LF.2 win is NOT "full-track analysis" — it is (a) same PCM bytes pre-analyzed AND played (eliminates BSAudit.2 cross-capture instability for local files), (b) pre-analysis happens before audio starts (BeatGrid available from frame 0), (c) no preview-clip indirection (the streaming path's iTunes Search preview is a different recording per track). True full-track stem + beat analysis would require StemSeparator tiling + Beat This! sliding-window aggregation — explicitly out of LF.2 scope; LF.3+ work if a downstream need arises (Matt approved "proceed as scoped, document the gap" 2026-05-27).

**Verification gates:**

- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter AudioInputRouterSignalStateTests` — 11/11 pass.
- `SOAK_TESTS=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter SoakTestHarnessTests` — 7/7 pass.
- `LF_FORMAT_COVERAGE=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter LocalFilePlaybackFormatCoverageTests` — 3/3 pass (M4A, MP3, FLAC).
- Full engine suite — 1281/1281 tests pass (1 known issue per the existing baseline).
- `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` — exit 0.
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -configuration Release build` — clean.

**Sessions captured:**

- LF.2 verification: `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-27T20-32-45Z/` — `BeatGrid installed: source=preparedCache, ..., bpm=118.1` at session.log line 5, before `raw tap capture started` (line 7). features.csv shows `grid_bpm=118.126` from frame 4; stems.csv shows non-zero per-stem energies from frame 0 (vocals=0.380, drums=0.244, bass=0.290, other=0.260).
- Pre-analysis latency confirmation: `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-27T21-16-55Z/` — same path, ~2 s wall-clock between `SessionRecorder started` and `BeatGrid installed`.

**Known risks and follow-ups:**

- **`Scripts/lf1_5_ab_compare.py` is framed for cross-path comparison.** Running it on LF-before vs LF-after produces a report whose header still says "LF vs Process-Tap." The numeric content is correct; re-framing the script for self-comparison is deferred (low priority — manual inspection of session logs is sufficient for LF.2's done-when).
- **Single-fixture verification.** All gates exercised against `love_rehab.m4a`. Cross-track behaviour on different genres / longer files / irregular meters is LF.3+ territory.
- **UX during pre-analysis is undefined.** ~2 s blank screen between env-var hook firing and first rendered frame. Acceptable for the dev hook; would need polish if LF graduates (LF.4).
- **`liveBeatGridAnalyzer` is now eager-initialised in LF.2 path** (was lazy at first live-inference call). Same instance is reused so there's no double-allocation; the lazy-init path still fires for streaming sessions where LF.2 isn't reached.
- **`SessionPreparer.analyzePreview` is now `public`.** This is a small API-surface expansion. Streaming-path callers are unchanged.

**Recommended next increment.** LF.3 — persistent content-keyed stem cache. The in-memory cache for LF.2 is process-lifetime only; a second launch re-runs pre-analysis. LF.3 would key the cache by content hash (e.g., file SHA-256) and persist to disk so the same file launches near-instantly on subsequent runs. Bigger lift than LF.2; would also benefit the streaming path (Spotify track ID → cached analysis surviving app restart). Worth a design discussion before scoping.

### Increment LF.1.5 — LF vs Process-Tap A/B Comparison ✅ (2026-05-27)

Measurement-only follow-up to LF.1. LF.1 proved the new local-file playback path *works*; LF.1.5 proves the new path's analysis output is *equivalent on the load-bearing musical metrics* and *characterizably different on the frequency-domain / level-sensitive metrics*. Two captured sessions on `love_rehab.m4a`, one throwaway analysis script, one markdown comparison report, and a small dev hook to make the tap-path capture reproducible.

**Landed changes:**

- **`PhospheneApp/PhospheneApp.swift`** — `PHOSPHENE_AUTOSTART_ADHOC=1` dev hook added to the existing `.task` modifier on the root view. When the env var is `1` AND `PHOSPHENE_LOCAL_FILE_PLAYBACK` is NOT set, fires the same code path as IdleView's "Start listening now" button (`engine.sessionManager.startAdHocSession()`). LF env var takes precedence; both unset means normal launch. ~10-line addition. Env-var-gated, dev-only — no new UI, no effect when unset.
- **`Scripts/lf1_5_ab_compare.py`** (new, ~370 lines, executable) — Python 3 throwaway-grade analysis script. Reads two session dirs' `features.csv` by column NAME (robust to CSP.3-style schema additions); detects the active analysis window as the longest contiguous `grid_bpm > 0` run; trims the middle 80 %; computes per-band-energy means, final BPM, final mood, mean spectral centroid, sub-bass onset proxy count; parses sample rate from `session.log`'s `raw tap capture started sr=<N> Hz` line; emits a markdown report with deltas table + tolerance verdict + interpretation. Not in any engine/app build target.
- **`docs/diagnostics/LF1.5_AB_COMPARISON_2026-05-27.md`** (new) — the comparison report. Two sessions: LF `2026-05-27T19-44-25Z` (2001 frames, 44.1 kHz tap, BeatGrid 118.7 BPM) vs tap `2026-05-27T19-47-18Z` (2700 frames, 48 kHz tap, BeatGrid 118.0 BPM). Verdict: CHARACTERIZABLE DELTAS. All breaches trace to expected structural differences (sample rate, volume residue, noise floor); the load-bearing musical metrics (BPM, subBass, sub-bass onset proxy) all within tolerance.
- **`docs/DECISIONS.md`** — D-128 Out-of-scope list updated: LF.1.5 done. New "Empirical characterization (LF.1.5, 2026-05-27)" subsection appended with headline deltas (BPM, sample rate, volume residue) and "Implications for downstream LF increments."
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — Audio Analysis Tuning gets a new "LF playback vs process-tap path — empirical deltas (LF.1.5)" subsection: load-bearing metrics equivalent; centroid + mood SR-shifted; per-band energies skew 17-24 % same-direction with the tap-path volume residue; authoring rule (use deviation primitives) is unchanged from D-026.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Audio Analysis Tuning pointer expanded to flag the new subsection.
- **`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md`** — `[dev-2026-05-27-f]` entry.

**Headline deltas** (middle 80 % of active window, LF vs tap):

- **BPM:** 118.7 vs 118.0 (Δ = 0.67 BPM, ✅ within ±3). Both paths share the same ~6 BPM offset vs Love Rehab's true 125 BPM — a Beat This! short-window characteristic, not a path-quality effect.
- **subBass mean:** 0.2597 vs 0.2144 (Δ = -17.4 %, ✅ within ±25 %).
- **bass mean:** 0.2316 vs 0.1754 (Δ = -24.3 %, ✅ within ±25 %).
- **treble mean:** 0.0013 vs 0.0010 (Δ = -23.0 %, ✅ within ±25 %).
- **mid mean:** 0.0140 vs 0.0095 (Δ = -32.4 %, ⚠ exceeded — but near noise floor; Love Rehab is bass-dominant, mid band is essentially empty).
- **spectralCentroid:** 0.0871 vs 0.0675 (Δ = -22.5 %, ⚠ exceeded ±15 % — explainable: FFT bin width scales with sample rate, shifting normalized-bin centroid for identical audio content).
- **valence:** 0.4800 vs 0.6435 (Δ = +34 %, ⚠ exceeded — downstream of centroid via `MoodClassifier` input index 6, not independent).
- **arousal:** 0.6130 vs 0.3830 (Δ = -37.5 %, ⚠ exceeded — same; downstream of centroid).
- **Sub-bass onset proxy** (p90 frame count): 113 vs 123 (Δ = +8.8 %, ✅ within ±25 %).

The 17-24 % skew across load-bearing bands all in the same direction is consistent with the volume residue (LF taps pre-mixer at ~0 dBFS, tap path post-output at ~-8 dBFS = 2.5× quieter on this host with default volume + Spotify-normalization-off RUNBOOK settings). AGC compresses but does not fully eliminate the level difference.

**Tests + build:**

- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter AudioInputRouterSignalStateTests` — 11/11 pass.
- `SOAK_TESTS=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter SoakTestHarnessTests` — 7/7 pass (regression gate for `.localFile` mode untouched + LF.1.5's gates for `.localFilePlayback`).
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' -configuration Release build` — clean.
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml PhospheneApp/PhospheneApp.swift` — 0 violations on touched files.

**Sessions captured:**

- LF: `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-27T19-44-25Z/` (2001 frames, raw_tap.wav 44100 Hz, BeatGrid 118.7 BPM, session.log clean of tap-reinstall lines).
- Tap: `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-27T19-47-18Z/` (2700 frames, raw_tap.wav 48000 Hz, BeatGrid 118.0 BPM, two `audio signal → silent` log lines are pre-afplay startup window + post-afplay tail — both outside the analysis window).

**Known risks and follow-ups:**

- **Single-fixture characterization.** love_rehab is bass-heavy electronic at 125 BPM. Cross-track variance (genres with stronger mid-band content, irregular meters, low-amplitude classical, etc.) is LF.2 territory if the LF arc proceeds. The deltas observed here may not generalize — the mid-noise-floor finding in particular is track-dependent.
- **`PHOSPHENE_AUTOSTART_ADHOC` hook remains in place.** Env-var-gated and dev-only; no effect when unset. Harmless to leave indefinitely and useful for future tap-path reproducibility. Revert is a single hunk if Matt prefers.
- **Comparison script is throwaway.** Not wired into CI; the comparison is a one-off measurement, not a regression gate. Re-execution recipe is documented in the script header + the report's Method section. Future LF increments may re-run if the analysis pipeline changes; that's a manual decision, not an automated one.
- **`spectralCentroid` Nyquist normalization is constant `24000 Hz`.** At 44.1 kHz the actual Nyquist is 22050, so the LF path's centroid is mathematically shifted by ~9 % vs the tap path's at 48 kHz (Nyquist 24000) for the same Hz content. Documented as expected; not a defect.

**Recommended next increment.** LF.2 — stem separation pre-analysis of the full local file. The LF path bypasses the 30 s Spotify-preview limitation, so the offline `BeatGrid` analyzer + `MIRPipeline` + `StemAnalyzer` can run over the full track, producing a higher-quality cached `TrackProfile` than the preview-clip-derived one used today. The cross-path centroid + mood shifts characterized here are path-stable (same fixture on same path = same numbers), so LF.2's stem-analysis output will be path-self-consistent without compensation.

### Increment LF.1 — Local-File Player Spike ✅ (2026-05-27)

First step in the LF.1 → LF.4 discovery arc exploring whether Phosphene playing local audio files itself (via `AVAudioEngine`) bypasses the documented pain points of the Core Audio process-tap path (DRM silent zeros, screen-capture permission, scrub-induced teardown, no playhead). Spike scope: prove the player + tap path works end-to-end and that the downstream analysis pipeline is genuinely source-agnostic.

**Landed changes:**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/LocalFilePlaybackProvider.swift`** (new, ~190 lines) — `AVAudioEngine` + `AVAudioPlayerNode` + `AVAudioFile` graph. Installs an analysis tap on the player node's output bus (pre-mixer, pre-volume), manually interleaves planar L/R into the L/R/L/R contract the existing pipeline expects, loops at EOF (re-schedules via `scheduleFile` completion handler), observes `AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange`. NSLock-serialized public API; `@preconcurrency import AVFoundation` for ObjC Sendable interop.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/AudioInputRouter.swift`** — added `InputMode.localFilePlayback(URL)` as a sibling to `.localFile(URL)` (which stays byte-identical for `SoakTestHarness`). New `startLocalFilePlayback(url:)` helper and `localFilePlaybackProvider` ivar. The router's metadata-observer path still fires (harmless — `StreamingMetadata` just polls Now Playing and finds nothing).
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/AudioInputRouter+SignalState.swift`** — mode-gate at the top of `scheduleNextReinstall()`: in `.localFile` and `.localFilePlayback`, the scheduler is dormant. There is no process tap to reinstall, and silence in a played file is real musical silence, not a teardown. `attemptTapReinstall`'s exhaustive switch updated to compile-fail on future enum additions.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Audio/AudioInputRouterSignalStateTests.swift`** — added 2 regression tests locking the mode-gate behavior (`test_scheduleNextReinstall_isNoOpInLocalFilePlaybackMode`, `test_scheduleNextReinstall_isNoOpInLocalFileMode`). Updated 6 pre-existing tests to set `currentMode = .systemAudio` so the scheduler exercises the attempt-counter logic the tests are locking (matching the established pattern in `test_attemptTapReinstall_skipsIfStateNotSilent`).
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift`** — added `@Published var localFilePlaybackActive: Bool = false`. Set synchronously at the start of `startLocalFilePlayback(url:)` so the first SwiftUI body re-render that follows can see it.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+PublicAPI.swift`** — new `startLocalFilePlayback(url:)` method (router start + stem pipeline + `sessionManager.startAdHocSession()` + initial `applyPreset`). Added an early-return guard at the top of `startAudio()` — `if localFilePlaybackActive { return }`. Without this guard, `PlaybackView.setup()`'s unconditional `engine.startAudio()` call would invoke `audioRouter.start(.systemAudio)`, which calls `stopInternal()` first and tears down the LocalFilePlaybackProvider milliseconds after it started. Verified during manual verification — the bug showed as an empty features.csv (audio path silently clobbered); the guard fixed it.
- **`PhospheneApp/PhospheneApp.swift`** — `.task` modifier on the root view reads `PHOSPHENE_LOCAL_FILE_PLAYBACK` and calls `engine.startLocalFilePlayback(url:)` when the env var points at a readable file. Empty / absent / unreadable env var: no log, normal launch proceeds.
- **`PhospheneApp/ContentView.swift`** — permission gate widened to `if permissionMonitor.isScreenCaptureGranted || engine.localFilePlaybackActive`. The LF playback path uses AVAudioEngine, not Core Audio process taps, so screen-capture permission is irrelevant — bypass keeps the spike's "no permission required" promise.

**Manual verification on `love_rehab.m4a`** (session `2026-05-27T15-55-19Z`):

1. ✅ Audio played for full file duration. features.csv contains 1684 frames spanning t=0.89 to t=28.96 s (matches the 29.93 s file minus the ~1 s engine-startup gap).
2. ⚠️ Visualizer rendered (1684 frames recorded, video.mp4 = 7.2 MB) — Matt must visually confirm the output is music-correlated; my mechanical check cannot judge visual content.
3. ✅ raw_tap.wav captured at 44100 Hz / 2 ch / Float32 interleaved, 28.2 s duration, max amplitude 1.000 / min -0.995 / RMS 0.305. Max hitting 1.0 reflects love_rehab's mastered peaks (Spotify normalization off — see `RUNBOOK.md`).
4. ✅ features.csv bass/mid/treble non-zero throughout (frame 0: 0.167/0.051/0.003; frame 800: 0.191/0.012/0.000; frame 1680: 0.177/0.011/0.001). Live BeatGrid installed at t=10s with bpm=118.5 (matches Love Rehab truth) — implies sub-bass onsets were firing at the expected rate.
5. ✅ session.log clean of `tap reinstall` / `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess` / `DRM silence` (grep returns zero matches).

Plus the bonus: the unified log shows the full LF.1 startup sequence:
- `[LF.1] local-file playback mode: ...` (env-var hook fired)
- `[LF.1] start: love_rehab.m4a 44100 Hz 2 ch` (provider opened the file)
- `[LF.1] Router started: local-file playback` (router accepted the mode)
- `[LF.1] LF playback router started: love_rehab.m4a` (engine confirmed)
- `[LF.1] startAudio skipped — LF playback already active` (the clobber-guard fired exactly when expected).

**Tests:**
- Engine `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` — **1269/1269 pass** (added 2; previously 1267).
- `SOAK_TESTS=1 swift test --filter SoakTestHarnessTests` — **7/7 pass** (regression gate for the untouched `.localFile` mode).
- App-scheme `xcodebuild test` — 5 pre-existing parallel-run flakes (`RenderPipelineICBTests.test_gpuDrivenRendering_cpuFrameTimeReduced`, `AppleMusicConnectionViewModelTests.*`) documented in CA.7b-FU-4's follow-ups + `project_test_baseline.md` memory. Not regressions: my changes don't touch Renderer/ICB or AppleMusic. Each passes cleanly in isolation per the documented flake profile.

**Build + lint:**
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp build` — clean (zero warnings on touched files).
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml` against the 8 touched files — 0 violations.
- `-configuration Release` build — clean.

**Documentation updates:**
- `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` (this entry).
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — D-128 (new).
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Audio Capture section adds `.localFilePlayback` mode + the screen-capture permission carve-out; Audio module map adds `LocalFilePlaybackProvider` and updates the `AudioInputRouter` + `AudioInputRouter+SignalState` entries.
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` — `[dev-2026-05-27-c]` entry.
- `CLAUDE.md` — the LF.1 prompt's "Module map" reference was to the canonical module map, which CLAUDE.md itself documents as living in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map`. Updated there; CLAUDE.md itself did not need a change.

**Known risks and follow-ups:**

- **Visual content not mechanically verifiable.** All 1684 render frames produced; whether the visualizer showed *music-correlated* output (the prompt's verification #2) requires Matt to watch the session. The raw signals (live BeatGrid lock at 118.5 BPM, non-zero bass/mid/treble across the full 28.96 s) say the upstream pipeline received clean audio, which is the necessary condition for music-correlated visuals — but not sufficient on its own.
- **Sub-bass onset count over a 5-second window** (verification #4's tighter sub-bound) is not directly exposed in features.csv. The proxy signal — live BeatGrid installation at 118.5 BPM matching truth within 1 BPM — is strong (the Beat This! analyzer would not have locked at that tempo without dense sub-bass onsets), but not the literal grep the prompt asked for. Could be added to the SessionRecorder per-frame schema in a future cleanup.
- **AVAudioFile open + AVAudioEngine.start() took ~2.3 s** in the verification run (env-var hook fires at t=17.04, provider start logs at t=19.34). Acceptable for the spike — audio is flowing before the user has time to notice — but worth measuring on cold-start scenarios in LF.2 to confirm it's not a problem under different conditions.
- **`AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange` restart is best-effort from the file beginning.** Mid-track resumption requires tracking the player's frame position; deferred to LF.4 if user-facing playback ships.
- **Loop-at-EOF is permanent** in the spike. A real product would surface a "play once" mode and a per-track / per-playlist looping toggle. LF.4 scope.
- **No `SessionManager` integration.** The spike transitions to ad-hoc reactive mode and never enters the planned-session flow. LF.4 scope.

**Recommended next increment.** LF.1.5 — A/B comparison of the new path vs. the process-tap path on the same audio. The spike proves the new path *works*; LF.1.5 would prove the analysis output is *equivalent* (or characterize the deltas — e.g., the LF path runs at the file's native 44.1 kHz, the process-tap path typically runs at 48 kHz, so beat-grid timing and FFT bin alignment will differ measurably).

### CA.7b-FU-4 — setMeshPresetBuffer/setMeshPresetFragmentBuffer retirement ✅ (2026-05-21)

Second of the Tier-2 Phase CA follow-up batch (CA-Audio-FU-5 + CA.7b-FU-4). Resolves the latent slot-1 buffer-binding collision flagged by the CA.7b audit (RENDERER_SUPPORTING.md:572 follow-up row; §Findings lines 431-451). `setMeshPresetBuffer(_:)` bound a per-preset world-state buffer at object/mesh `buffer(1)` — the same slot `MeshGenerator.draw()` writes `densityMultiplier` to. If a future mesh-shader preset ever set the preset buffer non-nil, `densityMultiplier` would silently clobber it. The collision was **latent only**: a Pass-0 grep confirmed `setMeshPresetBuffer` had zero non-nil production callers (its sole call site was `pipeline.setMeshPresetBuffer(nil)`, the reset). `setMeshPresetFragmentBuffer` (slot 4) did not collide but was equally caller-less.

**Matt's product call (Pass 0): option (b) — deprecate + remove the setter pair.** Three options were surfaced: (a) rebind to a free slot, (b) deprecate + remove, (c) document the latent collision with a `// TODO:`. Option (b) was the audit-author recommendation; precedent is CA.7-FU-4's `setRayMarchPresetComputeDispatch` retirement (`8ac45e73`). Re-introducing either setter is trivial if a future preset needs per-preset mesh-shader world state.

**Landed changes (commit `eb0aedc8`):**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/RenderPipeline.swift`** — removed the `meshPresetBuffer` + `meshPresetBufferLock` ivars, the `meshPresetFragmentBuffer` + `meshPresetFragmentBufferLock` ivars, and the `// MARK: - Mesh Preset Fragment Buffer (buffer(4))` section. Fixed the `directPresetFragmentBuffer` doc-comment's dangling "Follows the same pattern as `meshPresetBuffer`" reference.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/RenderPipeline+PresetSwitching.swift`** — removed the `setMeshPresetBuffer(_:)` and `setMeshPresetFragmentBuffer(_:)` declarations.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/RenderPipeline+MeshDraw.swift`** — removed the slot-1 object/mesh-buffer bind block and the slot-4 fragment-buffer bind block from `drawWithMeshShader`.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`** — removed the two `setMeshPreset*Buffer(nil)` reset calls in `applyPreset`.
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift`** — corrected the `arachneState` doc-comment: it claimed the Arachne webBuffer wires via `setMeshPresetBuffer`; the actual setter is `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer` (slot 6, D-092) — the comment was already stale before this increment.
- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Arachnid/ArachneState+Spider.swift`** — historical comment no longer names the retired `meshPresetFragmentBuffer` symbol; notes the CA.7b-FU-4 retirement so a future grep doesn't trap on a dead reference.

**GPU-contract doc sync (broader than the kickoff brief enumerated).** The retirement removed the slot-4 `meshPresetFragmentBuffer` binding entirely, which several GPU-contract docs described as a live "slot-4 reuse." Per CLAUDE.md (the capability registry + GPU contract must track code), all of these were corrected in the docs commit: `RENDERER.md` rows 182 (`RenderPipeline+MeshDraw.swift`), 190 (`RenderPipeline+PresetSwitching.swift` API inventory), 261 (slot-4 buffer-binding table row); `ARCHITECTURE.md` buffer-slot list, Module Map `RenderPipeline+MeshDraw` entry, and §GPU Contract Details `buffer(4)` block. Slot 1 is now `densityMultiplier`-exclusive; slot 4 is ray-march-`SceneUniforms`-exclusive.

**Verification:** SwiftLint baseline holds at 0 violations / 371 files. Engine builds clean (`swift build`). Engine test suite: **1,265 tests across 162 suites — all passing** (unchanged from CA-Audio-FU-5; no test referenced either setter, so no test surface changed). App builds clean. No production behaviour change — both setters were dead API; the slot-1 collision was latent.

**Doc updates:**
- `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/RENDERER_SUPPORTING.md` CA.7b-FU-4 row: Open → Resolved 2026-05-21 with Matt's product call + commit hash + scope summary; the §Findings follow-up-backlog summary line updated to reflect option (b).
- `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/RENDERER.md` rows 182 / 190 / 261 — slot-4 reuse claims removed, API inventory updated, file-length numbers re-synced (`82`→`69`, `194`→`170`).
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` buffer-slot list + Module Map + §GPU Contract Details `buffer(4)` block — slot-4 reuse statements removed.
- This ENGINEERING_PLAN.md entry.

**Known risks and follow-ups:** none for the increment — both setters were verified dead before removal, and the engine test suite (the authoritative renderer check) is fully green. Two observations surfaced for future increments: (1) **pre-existing CA.7-FU-4 doc-drift** — `RENDERER.md` lines 180 + 190 still list the `RayMarchPresetComputeDispatch` typealias / `setRayMarchPresetComputeDispatch` setter even though CA.7-FU-4 retired them in code (`8ac45e73`); not fixed here (out of CA.7b-FU-4 scope), recommend folding into a future Renderer doc-pruning pass. (2) **App-scheme test flake environment** — `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp test` runs the engine `PhospheneEngineTests.xctest` (1,265 tests) plus `PhospheneAppTests` (333) together at a parallelism that produces non-deterministic timing/GPU flakes (observed across four runs this session: `FirstAudioDetectorTests`, `AppleMusicConnectionViewModelTests`, `StreamingMetadataTests`, `RenderPipelineICBTests`, `SessionManagerTests` — each flaked on a different run, each passes cleanly in isolation and under `swift test`). Not a regression from either Tier-2 increment; recommend a future App-side increment widen the affected suites' timing margins or mark GPU suites `.serialized`.

### CA-Audio-FU-5 — InputLevelMonitor regression tests ✅ (2026-05-21)

First of the Tier-2 Phase CA follow-up batch (CA-Audio-FU-5 + CA.7b-FU-4). Closes the zero-test-coverage gap on `InputLevelMonitor` flagged by the CA-Audio audit (AUDIO.md:807 follow-up row; AUDIO.md:232 finding). The 322-line audio-quality observer is production-active (consumer at `VisualizerEngine.swift:415`) and implements a non-trivial state machine — `0.9995`/update peak-envelope decay (~21 s time constant at the 94 Hz analysis rate), 30-frame grade hysteresis (`gradeSwitchFrames=30`), a warmup gate (`warmupFrames=60`), and a peak-only classifier (treble-fraction gating removed post-2026-04-17T21-05-47Z after the Oxytocin false-positive) — but had no dedicated tests prior to this increment. A refactor or tuning change could silently regress any of these with no test signal; the failure mode would be "the diagnostic overlay shows the wrong grade on real music."

**Landed changes (commit `f570688f`):**

- **New test file** `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Audio/InputLevelMonitorTests.swift` — 8 regression tests covering the 6 audit-recommended cases + 2 productivity additions:
  1. `test_submitSamples_peakDecaysAt0_9995` (audit #1) — drives a known peak then N silent submissions; asserts the published `peakDBFS` matches the analytical `0.9995^N` decay within Float tolerance (`< 0.01` dBFS).
  2. `test_submitMagnitudes_bandEnergyDominantBand` (audit #2, renamed from `bandEnergyEMA` to reflect the dominant-band-routing assertion shape) — sub/mid/treble band-energy routing verified via dominant-band spectra (a band-index swap in the bin-bound math would flip the asserted ratios).
  3. `test_recompute_warmupReturnsUnknown` (audit #3) — `.unknown` / "warming up" before `warmupFrames` (60) sample submissions accumulate; a real classification once warmup completes.
  4. `test_recompute_belowCriticalReturnsRed` (audit #4) — sustained peak at -20 dBFS (below `peakCriticalDBFS` -15) classifies `.red` with a dBFS-naming reason string.
  5. `test_recompute_hysteresisRequires30Frames` (audit #5) — drives `.red`, spikes to a `.green` candidate; asserts the 29th post-spike recompute still publishes `.red` and the 30th flips it (off-by-one defence on `gradeSwitchFrames=30`).
  6. `test_reset_clearsAllEnvelopes` (audit #6) — `reset()` zeroes every envelope, the frame counter, and overwrites the published snapshot with the default.
  7. `test_classification_isPeakOnlyNotTrebleSensitive` (added) — Oxytocin defence: drives a high peak with a bass-only spectrum, then floods the EMAs with treble-only spectra; the grade must stay `.green` throughout. A regression that re-introduced treble-balance gating would flip this and the Oxytocin false-positive would be back.
  8. `test_thresholdConstants_matchDesignSpec` (added) — locks `peakWarningDBFS`/-9, `peakCriticalDBFS`/-15, `warmupFrames`/60 against silent retunes (same shape as `AudioInputRouterSignalStateTests.test_reinstallDelays_matchDesignSpec`).

**Zero production-code changes required.** `InputLevelMonitor`'s public surface (`submitSamples`, `submitMagnitudes`, `currentSnapshot`, `reset`) is directly testable and consumes raw `Float` buffers — no injectable dependency, no testability seam, no test double needed. Tests use a `submitSamples(_:_:)` helper to pass `[Float]` arrays via `withUnsafeBufferPointer` without tripping the `force_unwrapping` lint rule.

**Test methodology.** No real-time waiting — `InputLevelMonitor`'s decay is per-`submitSamples`-call, not per-wall-clock-second, so a test that drives 100 submissions to verify the decay window runs in ~1 ms. Float assertions use absolute tolerance (Float multiplication over 100 iterations drifts in the 5th decimal). Each test instantiates a fresh monitor — no shared state, parallel-safe, no `@Suite(.serialized)` needed.

**Verification:** SwiftLint baseline holds at 0 violations / 371 files (test files in `PhospheneEngine/Tests/` are excluded per `.swiftlint.yml:8`, so the file count is unchanged). Engine test suite: **1,265 tests across 162 suites — all passing** (up from 1,257; +8 new tests). App test suite: 333 tests / 60 suites — the engine-target test file is not built by the App scheme, so the App surface is unaffected; the App run surfaced only pre-existing `@MainActor`-contention timing flakes (`FirstAudioDetectorTests`, `AppleMusicConnectionViewModelTests`, `StreamingMetadataTests` — all pass cleanly in isolation; see Risks below).

**Doc updates:**
- `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/AUDIO.md` CA-Audio-FU-5 row: Open → Resolved 2026-05-21 with commit hash + per-test name + scope rationale.
- This ENGINEERING_PLAN.md entry.

**Risks and follow-ups:** none for the increment itself — the tests are read-only against existing public API and require no production-code change. The App test suite exhibited a pre-existing `@MainActor`-contention timing flake during verification: `FirstAudioDetectorTests` (3 tests using 600 ms `Task.sleep` over a 250 ms internal timer; the test file's own line-35 comment documents the mechanism) failed under the full parallel App suite but passed cleanly in isolation (7/7, 0.6–1.2 s each). This is the same flake class as the documented `AppleMusicConnectionViewModel` timing/race flake and the CLAUDE.md "@MainActor debounce test timing margins under parallel execution" note (U.11). It is not a regression: this increment's code lives in the engine test target, which the App scheme does not build. Recommend a future App-side increment widen `FirstAudioDetectorTests`' sleep margins (or mark the suite `.serialized`) — out of scope for FU-5.

### CA-Audio-FU-4 — Tap-reinstall regression tests ✅ (2026-05-21)

Second of the Tier-1 Phase CA follow-up batch (CA-Presets-FU-4 + CA-Audio-FU-4). Closes the zero-test-coverage gap on `AudioInputRouter+SignalState.swift` flagged by the CA-Audio audit (AUDIO.md:806 follow-up row; AUDIO.md:160 finding). The 105-line extension implements the critical scrub-recovery path (3 attempts with 3/10/30 s backoff) but had no dedicated tests prior to this increment — a refactor or tuning regression could silently break audio recovery on every scrub-induced silence event with no test signal.

**Landed changes (commit `a6404575`):**

- **New test file** `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Audio/AudioInputRouterSignalStateTests.swift` — 9 regression tests covering the 5 audit-recommended cases + 4 productivity additions:
  1. `test_scheduleNextReinstall_attemptCountSequence` (audit #1) — counter advances 1→2→3 then caps at 3, with no further workItem scheduling on the 4th call.
  2. `test_scheduleNextReinstall_doesNotDoubleScheduleWhilePending` (added) — guards the `guard reinstallWorkItem == nil else { return false }` branch at line 51; a regression would double-bump attempts on overlapping silence callbacks and burn through the 3-attempt cap on the first scrub.
  3. `test_cancelPendingReinstall_resetsAttempts` (audit #2) — verifies cancel zeroes both the workItem handle AND the attempt counter.
  4. `test_handleSignalStateChange_silentSchedulesReinstall` (added) — the `.silent` entry point from the SilenceDetector callback.
  5. `test_handleSignalStateChange_activeCancelsPending` (added) — the `.active` recovery entry point.
  6. `test_attemptTapReinstall_skipsIfStateNotSilent` (audit #3) — verifies the state-changed guard at line 78-83 (returns to `.active` during backoff window does NOT trigger reinstall).
  7. `test_backoffExhausted_noNewScheduling` (audit #4) — after 3 attempts the counter caps and no new workItem is scheduled; stable under repeated silence-callback firings.
  8. `test_nextActiveToSilent_resetsAttempts` (audit #5) — full silence→active→silence cycle, second silence run starts at attempts=1 (not continuation from prior).
  9. `test_reinstallDelays_matchDesignSpec` (added) — locks the `[3.0, 10.0, 30.0]` tuning against future silent retuning; if a real tuning change ships, this test must be updated in the same increment with the rationale in the commit message.

**Zero production-code changes required.** The internal init `init(capture:metadata:silenceDetector:)` was already in place as a testability seam at `AudioInputRouter.swift:91-101` (taking an injectable `SilenceDetector` which itself has injectable `timeProvider`). All reinstall-machine functions (`handleSignalStateChange`, `scheduleNextReinstall`, `cancelPendingReinstall`, `attemptTapReinstall`, `performTapReinstall`) are package-internal-visibility and accessible via `@testable import Audio`. The `reinstallAttempts` / `reinstallWorkItem` / `reinstallDelays` fields likewise.

**Test methodology.** The asyncAfter'd workItems in `scheduleNextReinstall` use real wall-clock delays of 3/10/30 s. Tests do NOT wait — they either simulate the workItem firing by directly calling the relevant API (e.g., calling `scheduleNextReinstall` again after a `clearPendingWithoutResettingAttempts` helper), or they verify the synchronous side effects (counter, workItem handle) without exercising the deferred execution path. Each test that schedules cleans up via `defer { router.cancelPendingReinstall() }` so background asyncAfter calls don't fire mid-next-test. All 9 tests run in ~1 ms each; total suite delta is ~9 ms wall-clock.

**Verification:** SwiftLint baseline holds at 0 violations / 371 files. Engine test suite: **1,257 tests across 162 suites — all passing** (up from 1,248; +9 new tests). App test suite: 333 tests / 60 suites — all passing (no change). Build clean on both `swift build --package-path PhospheneEngine` and `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp test`.

**Doc updates:**
- `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/AUDIO.md` CA-Audio-FU-4 row: Open → Resolved 2026-05-21 with commit hash + per-test name + scope rationale.
- This ENGINEERING_PLAN.md entry.

**Risks and follow-ups:** none. The tests are read-only against existing internal API and require no production-code change. If a future refactor narrows the visibility of any of the reinstall-machine methods (e.g., making `scheduleNextReinstall` truly private), the tests will fail to compile and the refactor author will need to either preserve the internal-visibility surface or move the relevant tests behind a different seam.

### CA-Presets-FU-4 — Lumen Mosaic init-failure instrumentation ✅ (2026-05-21)

First of the Tier-1 Phase CA follow-up batch (CA-Presets-FU-4 + CA-Audio-FU-4). Closes the silent-allocation-failure diagnosis gap surfaced by the CA-Presets audit and documented in the BUG-016 addendum (`docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md:111-141`). **BUG-016 stays Open** — instrumentation is not a fix; the increment closes the gap that prevented previous reproductions from being characterised post-hoc.

**Landed changes (commit `cb8cb0bb`):**

- **`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Lumen/LumenPatternEngine.swift`** (lines 580-595) — `Logging.session.error(...)` added inside the `init?(device:seed:)` failure branch. Writes to the unified log under category `"session"`. Captures the failure regardless of which App-side caller triggers the init (future-proofs against caller-site refactors that might drop the App-side log).
- **`PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`** (lines 165-187, the LumenMosaic instantiation site inside `applyPreset .rayMarch`) — `sessionRecorder?.log(...)` added alongside the existing `logger.error(...)` call. Writes to `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/<ts>/session.log` so the next reproduction is greppable from the on-disk artifact without a `log show` invocation.

**Belt-and-braces rationale:** the BUG-016 addendum's original recipe (`Logging.session?.log(...)` at the App-side site) was structurally inverted on channel routing — `Logging.session` is an `os.Logger`, not a `SessionRecorder`, so it writes only to the unified log. The on-disk `session.log` file is owned by `SessionRecorder.log(_:)`. The increment covers both channels: App-side gets the on-disk write; engine-internal gets the unified-log write with caller-site-agnostic coverage. Two corrections to the original addendum (channel routing + line-number citations) landed inline in the BUG-016 addendum follow-on note.

**Retrieval predicates for the next reproduction:**

```bash
# On-disk session.log (App-side SessionRecorder write)
grep "LumenPatternEngine: failed to allocate slot-8 buffer" \
  ~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/<ts>/session.log

# Unified log (engine-internal Logging.session.error write)
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.phosphene" AND category == "session"' \
  --info --last 30m | grep "LumenPatternEngine init failed"
```

**Verification:** SwiftLint baseline holds at 0 violations / 371 files (one line-length violation surfaced and fixed in-pass via multi-line string literal). Engine test suite: 1,248 tests across 162 suites — all passing (unchanged; no test surface modified). App build: `BUILD SUCCEEDED` on `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp build`. App tests: passing (no test surface modified).

**Doc updates:**
- `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` BUG-016 addendum extended with the new instrumentation note + corrected retrieval predicates.
- `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/PRESETS.md` CA-Presets-FU-4 row: Open → Resolved 2026-05-21 with commit hash + a summary of the two corrections to the original recipe.
- This ENGINEERING_PLAN.md entry.

**Risks and follow-ups:** if BUG-016 reproduces and neither retrieval predicate fires, the failure mode is one of the 4 non-allocation candidates (stuck-on-previous, visual artifacts, no-audio-response, or pale-dominant LM.9 regression) documented in the BUG-016 addendum's "5 candidate failure modes" table. Path-of-investigation is unchanged for those cases.

### CA-Audio-FU-9 — ARCH structural-claims sync (Module Map + §Key Types + per-source-file inline drift) ✅ (2026-05-21)

Twelfth Phase CA increment of the day — the consolidation pass for the 7-in-a-row Module Map drift pattern surfaced across CA.5 / CA.6 / CA.7a / CA.7b / CA-Audio / CA-Presets / CA-Shared. **Closes Phase CA: every Swift engine surface is audited AND the structural-claim documentation matches the code.**

**Scope expanded by CA-Shared closeout** from the original "Module Map only" filing to cover three additional axes: ARCH §Key Types (3 fictional struct claims surfaced by CA-Shared); ARCH §GPU Contract Details (verified clean in this pass — slot bindings match RenderPipeline + SpectralHistoryBuffer); per-source-file inline doc-comment drift (3 items surfaced by CA-Shared).

**Landed changes:**

- **§Module Map Shared/ block** — 5 missing entries added: `Shared.swift` module marker, the four `AudioFeatures+*` extension files (Analyzed / Frame / Metadata / SceneUniforms), `StemFeatures.swift` (D-099 / DM.2), `BeatSyncSnapshot.swift` (CLAUDE.md §Defect Handling artifact), the four `SessionRecorder+*` extensions (CSV / RawTap / Stems / Video), `BUG012Probe.swift` (BUG-012-i1 instrumentation, read-only), `UserFacingError.swift` + `UserFacingError+Presentation.swift`, `Dashboard/DashboardTokens.swift`. RenderPass enum cases corrected to include `mv_warp` and `staged`. SpectralHistoryBuffer entry's reserved-section description updated to reflect post-beat-grid layout (beat_times / bpm / lock_state / session_mode / downbeat_times / drift_ms through slot [2429]).

- **§Module Map Presets/ block** — 16 missing entries added: `Presets.swift` module marker, three `PresetLoader+*` extensions (`+Mesh`, `+Utilities`, `+WarpPreamble`), `PresetMetadata`, `PresetMaxDuration`, `PresetStage`, `SpectralCartographText`, two `FidelityRubric+*` extensions (`+Mandatory`, `+Optional`), `AuroraVeil/AuroraVeilState.swift`, three `FerrofluidOcean/*` files (`FerrofluidMesh`, `FerrofluidParticles`, `+InitialPositions`), four `Arachnid/ArachneState+*` extensions (`+BackgroundWebs`, `+ListeningPose`, `+Spider`, `+M7Diag`). The CA-Presets "18 missing files" finding is now closed (CA-Presets's count was off by 2 — actual missing = 16 once duplicates were de-duped against existing inline references).

- **§Module Map Diagnostics/ block** — 2 missing entries added: `SoakTestHarness+AudioGen` (procedural audio generator extracted for file-length compliance) and `SoakTestHarness+Reporting` (JSON + Markdown report builder extracted for file-length compliance).

- **§Module Map Renderer/ block** — 1 missing entry added: `RayTracing/RayIntersector+Internal` (the `packed_float3` vs `SIMD3<Float>` workaround file cross-referenced from `AudioFeatures+SceneUniforms.swift:9`).

- **§Module Map App/ block** — verified close to complete (~109 referenced entries vs 108 actual files); no systemic gap.

- **§Key Types section** — comprehensive rewrite. Deleted three entirely fictional struct claims (`BandEnergy`, `SpectralFeatures`, `OnsetPulses`) — these have never existed in code; the corresponding data lives inside FeatureVector. Moved three misplaced types (`Particle`, `SessionState`, `AudioSignalState`) out of the "Shared Module" sub-block into a new "Cross-module reference types" sub-block (their actual modules: Renderer/Presets, Session, Audio respectively). Added missing RenderPass cases (`mv_warp`, `staged`). Corrected FeatureVector field documentation — was claiming structural prediction + camera uniforms live in floats 1–24 when they actually live in separate structs (StructuralPrediction + SceneUniforms); now lists actual field layout. Clarified EmotionalState's `quadrant` as a computed property. Corrected SpectralHistoryBuffer reserved-section description (was [2402..2419]; actual is [2402..2429] through driftMs). Added missing types: `BeatSyncSnapshot`, `MetadataSource`, `StemSampleBuffer`, `Smoother`, `UMABuffer`, `UMARingBuffer`, `UserFacingError`.

- **Per-source-file inline doc-comment drift** — 3 items fixed in this commit: `AnalyzedFrame.swift:35` "Packed feature vector for GPU uniform upload (96 bytes)" → 192 bytes (D-099 / DM.2 post-extension size); `SpectralHistoryBuffer.swift:78` class-level "[2402..4095] reserved" rewritten to enumerate the beat-grid metadata layout through [2429]; `DashboardTokens.swift:5` "D-080" → "D-081 / DASH.1.1" (D-080 is the QR.2 stem-affinity decision, not the placement rationale).

**Verification:** SwiftLint baseline holds at 0 / 371. `swift build --package-path PhospheneEngine` → Build complete (3.84s). Engine test suite: 1,248 tests across 162 suites — all passing (unchanged; only doc-comment lines touched in Swift code). App test suite: 333 tests / 60 suites — all passing.

**Phase CA closure status:** with FU-9 landed, every Swift engine surface in `PhospheneEngine/Sources/` and `PhospheneApp/` is (a) audited via a capability-registry document AND (b) structurally documented in ARCHITECTURE.md without fictional claims or misplaced entries. **Phase CA is complete.** The only remaining audit work is the optional `.metal` shader audit (CA-Preset-Shaders) — recommend NOT scheduling per CA-Shared closeout (FidelityRubric + M7 manual review already cover that surface; methodology is distinct from capability-registry verdicts).

**Approach validation:** the consolidation-pass approach worked well — single-pass file inventory + per-block diff + targeted insertion edits. The CA-Shared "scope extension" recommendation to fold §Key Types + §GPU Contract Details + inline drift into FU-9 was correct: doing all four axes in one pass kept the doc-coherence story tight rather than scattering related fixes across multiple increments. Total wall-clock for FU-9 itself was ~1 session; the combined FU-1 + FU-2 + FU-3 + FU-9 wall-clock for the day was ~3 sessions. **The 7-in-a-row Module Map drift pattern is now closed.** Future audits should still surface drift when it appears, but the systemic backlog is gone.

### CA-Shared-FU-1 (wire-up) + CA-Shared-FU-2 (retire) + CA-Shared-FU-3 (retire) ✅ (2026-05-21)

Same-day resolution of three CA-Shared follow-ups, all under Matt's direction:

- **CA-Shared-FU-1 — wire up `UserFacingError.retryStatus` + `.isConditionBound`.** Matt's product call: wire up. Two consumer changes:
  - `LocalizedCopy.string(for: .spotifyRateLimited)` now sources the "attempt N of 3" suffix from `error.retryStatus.description` via new helper `appendRetryStatus(base:status:)`. Localizable.strings `error.connection.spotify_rate_limited` value reduced from `"Spotify is being slow — still trying (attempt %d of 3)"` to the base headline only — the suffix is composed by the helper. Output identical: `"Spotify is being slow — still trying (attempt 2 of 3)"`.
  - `PlaybackErrorBridge.showSilenceExtendedToast` now constructs toasts via new `toast(for:severity:source:)` helper that gates `duration: .infinity` AND `conditionID` on `error.isConditionBound`. Replaces the prior hardcoded silence-specific values. Behaviour unchanged for `silenceExtended` (still condition-bound, still gets `.infinity` duration + conditionID); future condition-bound errors (`audioLevelsLow`, `silenceBrief` if producers fire them) automatically route through the same gate.
  - Five new regression tests (3 in LocalizedCopyTests, 2 in PlaybackErrorBridgeTests).

- **CA-Shared-FU-2 — retire `SpectralHistoryPublishing` + `StemSampleBuffering` protocols.** Matt's product call: retire. Both public protocol declarations deleted from their respective files; concrete classes (`SpectralHistoryBuffer`, `StemSampleBuffer`) drop the protocol conformance and keep only `@unchecked Sendable`. Public method surface unchanged — every method was already declared `public` directly on the class. Test suite green without modification (tests already used concrete types). Same shape as CA.7-FU-4 dead-API retirement: if a future test or DI seam genuinely needs a protocol, re-introducing one is trivial.

- **CA-Shared-FU-3 — retire `Smoother.step(current:target:at:)`.** Matt's product call: retire. Convenience method deleted from `Smoother.swift`; doc-comment updated to reflect the simpler shape (`factor(at:)` only, inline EMA at call sites — matches the current convention in BeatDetector / BandEnergyProcessor). All 4 existing `factor(at:)` callers unaffected.

**Verification:** SwiftLint baseline holds at 0 violations / 371 files. Engine test suite: 1,248 tests across 162 suites — all passing (unchanged). App test suite: **333 tests across 60 suites — all passing** (up from 328; 5 new FU-1 regression tests). `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp test` → TEST SUCCEEDED.

CA-Shared follow-up table updated with Resolved entries citing Matt's product calls + behaviour summary; Summary verdict counts updated (production-orphan: 2 protocols + 3 accessors → 0). All three follow-ups closed in one commit-cluster ahead of the FU-9 ARCH sync increment.

### CA-Shared — Shared Capability Audit ✅ (2026-05-21)

Eleventh per-subsystem audit pass under Phase CA — **closes the last unaudited Swift surface in the engine module.** Produced [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/SHARED.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/SHARED.md) — 25 Swift files / 3,515 LoC (matches kickoff). Single-pass direct-read, no Explore agents needed; methodology stable since CA-Audio.

**Headline findings: all 22 type-declaring files `production-active`; zero `broken-but-claimed`; 2 production-orphan protocols (`SpectralHistoryPublishing`, `StemSampleBuffering`) + 3 production-orphan accessors (`UserFacingError.retryStatus`, `UserFacingError.isConditionBound`, `Smoother.step`); 4 missing Module Map entries + 3 entirely fictional ARCH §Key Types struct claims; 1 D-127 stems.csv producer-side gap.** Zero new BUG entries filed.

**All seven required invariant verifications landed clean.** (1) **D-099 / DM.2 Common.metal struct extension intact** (Swift producer side) — `FeatureVector` is `@frozen public struct ... Sendable` with 48 floats / 192 bytes; `StemFeatures` is `@frozen public struct ... Sendable, Equatable` with 64 floats / 256 bytes; first 32 / first 16 floats byte-identical to original DM.0 layout. Producer chain: MIRPipeline (DSP) → AnalyzedFrame → render-thread GPU buffer write at slot 2/3. (2) **UserFacingError ↔ UX_SPEC §9 alignment exhaustive 29:29** — every case maps to exactly one §9.1/§9.2/§9.3/§9.4 row; every row has a corresponding case. (3) **SessionRecorder drawable-size-lock invariant (Failed Approach #28) clean** — `videoSizeStableThreshold = 30` frames deferred-init; `writerRelockThreshold = 90` frames mismatch-skip-then-relock; `handleDimensionMismatch` skips frames rather than blits-into-wrong-geometry. (4) **TrackMetadata + PreFetchedTrackProfile + MetadataSource boundary closed** (CA.3 ↔ CA-Audio ↔ CA-Shared) — types live in `AudioFeatures+Metadata.swift` lines 10/30/69; producer chain via MetadataPreFetcher + StreamingMetadata; consumer chain via VisualizerEngine + AudioInputRouter + Session preparer. (5) **BUG012Probe surface characterised read-only** — 320 LoC, 12 static methods + Snapshot struct; NSLock-guarded with `nonisolated(unsafe)` storage matching the D-079 precedent; alarm-on-count>1 in stem/FFT in-flight counters; no candidate root cause beyond the existing 2026-05-20 race-surface analysis surfaced. **No BUG-012 addendum filed.** (6) **SpectralHistoryBuffer slot mapping verified** — kickoff claims confirmed: `[2402..2417] beat_times[16]`, `[2420] session_mode`. Full reserved-section layout: 2400 writeHead / 2401 samplesValid / 2402-2417 beat_times / 2418 bpm / 2419 lockState / 2420 sessionMode / 2421-2428 downbeat_times / 2429 driftMs. (7) **DashboardTokens placement clean** — kept in Shared; consumed by BOTH Renderer/Dashboard/* (DASH.7 builders via CA.7b) AND App/Views/Dashboard/* (DashboardOverlayView, DashboardRowView, DashboardCardView). Moving to Renderer would force App-side dependency on Renderer.

**Notable findings:**
- **Two production-orphan protocols** filed as CA-Shared-FU-2 — `SpectralHistoryPublishing` and `StemSampleBuffering` are declared and conformed-to in the same file each; production code stores the concrete class type. Documented test-doubles motivation not exercised.
- **Three production-orphan accessors** filed as CA-Shared-FU-1 + CA-Shared-FU-3 — `UserFacingError.retryStatus` (documented as retry-aware toast suffix routing primitive — not wired; LocalizedCopy hand-codes the strings instead); `UserFacingError.isConditionBound` (documented as PlaybackErrorBridge dismiss-gate — not wired); `Smoother.step(current:target:at:)` (zero consumers; only `factor(at:)` is consumed).
- **stems.csv producer-side gap** filed as CA-Shared-FU-4 — `drumsEnergyDevSmoothed` (StemFeatures float 43, V.9 / D-127) is recorded into the GPU buffer + live render path but the SessionRecorder's `csvRow(stems:)` formatter at lines 50-76 omits the column. Offline replay tools (Scripts/analyze_*.py, PresetSessionReplay) cannot inspect this field post-hoc — a real diagnostic gap for any future Ferrofluid Ocean tuning or aurora-coupling validation work.
- **ARCH §Key Types catastrophic drift** — lines 799/801/802 claim `BandEnergy` / `SpectralFeatures` / `OnsetPulses` exist as Swift structs. **They do not exist anywhere in the codebase.** The corresponding data lives inside `FeatureVector` (bass/mid/treble fields; spectralCentroid/spectralFlux; beatBass/beatMid/beatTreble). Lines 813/814/815 list `Particle` / `SessionState` / `AudioSignalState` under the "Shared Module" header — these live in Renderer+Presets / Session / Audio respectively. Line 816 lists `RenderPass` enum cases missing `mv_warp` and `staged`. Line 779 `FeatureVector` field documentation conflates `structuralPrediction` + `camera uniforms` into "Floats 1–24" — neither lives in FeatureVector. **Bundled into CA-Audio-FU-9 with a scope-extension recommendation: FU-9 should cover §Module Map + §Key Types + §GPU Contract Details in one pass.**

**Four follow-ups filed (CA-Shared-FU-1 through CA-Shared-FU-4):** FU-1 retire-or-wire `UserFacingError.retryStatus` + `.isConditionBound`; FU-2 retire-or-keep-by-design `SpectralHistoryPublishing` + `StemSampleBuffering` protocols; FU-3 retire-or-keep `Smoother.step` convenience accessor; FU-4 extend stems.csv writer to include `drumsEnergyDevSmoothed` (D-127 column).

**Doc-drift fixes landed in this increment:** CLAUDE.md §What NOT To Do line "Per `UX_SPEC.md §8`" corrected to `§9.4` (error taxonomy lives at §9; §8 is Recovery & Adaptation Flows); CLAUDE.md `§8.5` jargon-avoidance line corrected to `§9.5` (DOC.3 refactor moved Copy Principles from §8 to §9). UserFacingError.swift:7 already correctly cited §9 — the producer-side authority was always right; only the CLAUDE.md pointer was stale. ARCH §Module Map + §Key Types drift bundled into CA-Audio-FU-9.

**Phase CA closure status: every Swift engine surface is now audited.** Remaining audit work: (a) CA-Audio-FU-9 Module Map Sync (cross-cutting; now a 7-in-a-row systemic finding, recommended-prioritised); (b) optional `.metal` shader audit (CA-Preset-Shaders — methodology-distinct from capability-registry verdicts; recommend NOT scheduling unless a specific shader-fidelity question warrants the cost; existing FidelityRubric + M7 manual review already cover that surface).

**Approach validation:** single-pass direct-read at 3.5k LoC scaled cleanly (no Explore agents); the per-accessor production-orphan check (CA.7b refinement) caught three accessor orphans that "file-level any-consumer" would have missed (`.retryStatus`, `.isConditionBound`, `Smoother.step`); Pass 0 BUG-status cross-check caught the CLAUDE.md `UX_SPEC.md §8 error taxonomy` reference drift before any file-read. The kickoff's "20-25 files" scope estimate was accurate (25 actual). **Recommended next subsystem: CA-Audio-FU-9** — the 7-in-a-row Module Map drift now demands consolidated resolution; the CA-Shared discovery of three entirely fictional ARCH §Key Types struct claims extends FU-9's scope beyond simple file-listing sync into structural-claim validation. **Phase CA can declare closed after FU-9 lands.**

### CA-Presets — Presets Capability Audit (Swift slice) ✅ (2026-05-21)

Tenth per-subsystem audit pass under Phase CA — closes the last unaudited engine module (Presets/ Swift slice; .metal shaders deferred). Produced [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/PRESETS.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/PRESETS.md) — 30 Swift files / **9,175 LoC** (kickoff said 3,129 — counted only the infrastructure cluster; per-preset state cluster added 5,116 LoC and certification cluster added 930 LoC) + 16 JSON sidecars (schema-verification reads). Single increment, single-pass; direct-read all infrastructure + certification files + AuroraVeil/Gossamer/FerrofluidMesh, parallel-Explore-agent reads for the high-LoC Arachne + Lumen + FerrofluidParticles clusters.

**Headline findings: all 30 Swift files `production-active`; zero `broken-but-claimed` at code level; 3 doc-level findings (ARCH §Module Map drift 18 missing + 4 retired-file references; `LumenPatternState` stride 376→568 per LM.4.7; `AuroraVeil.json "passes": []` under-documented semantics); 1 BUG-016 producer-side candidate root cause filed as addendum (`LumenPatternEngine.init?` returns nil silently on `device.makeBuffer` failure with no `os.Logger` / `sessionRecorder` log — silent allocation failure could explain the symptom).** Zero new BUG entries (no new BUG-017); BUG-016 addendum extends existing-Open BUG body.

**All seven required invariant verifications landed clean.** (1) **D-094 ArachneSpiderGPU 80-byte invariant intact** — struct definition at `ArachneState+Spider.swift:44-77` is exactly 80 bytes (4 × Float header + 8 × SIMD2<Float> tips); listening-pose lift adjusts `tip[0]`/`tip[1]` clip-space Y CPU-side in `writeSpiderToGPU()` without struct extension. (2) **D-095 V.7.7C foreground-hero architecture intact** — `writeBuildStateToWebs0()` packs `bs.anchors[]` (4-bit count + 6 × 4-bit indices) into `webs[0].rngSeed` byte offset 28 via `Self.packPolygonAnchors(_:)`; spider trigger on `features.bassAttRel > 0.30` (V.7.7C.3 correct form, NOT the retired Failed Approach #57 `subBass + bassAttackRatio < 0.55`); polygon decoding uses Fisher-Yates → angle sort → largest-angular-gap bridge pair. (3) **BUG-011 round 8 invariants intact** — `frameDurationSeconds = 2.775`, `radialDurationSeconds = 1.389`, `spiralChordsPerBeat = 3.24`, `spiralChordAccumulator: Float = 0`, `stemEnergySilenceThreshold = 0.02`; **critical ordering verified**: `pausedBySpider = spiderBlend > 0.01` set BEFORE `audioSilent = stemEnergySum < 0.02` (ArachneState.swift:826-836); `_presetCompletionEvent: public let` for cross-module PresetSignaling conformance; `Arachne.json wait_for_completion_event: true` + `PresetMaxDuration.maxDuration(forSection:)` returns `.infinity` for flagged presets. (4) **D-097 particle-siblings intact** — `ParticleGeometryRegistry.knownPresetNames = ["Murmuration"]`; zero Drift Motes remnants (grep across `PhospheneEngine/Sources` + `PhospheneApp/`); `FerrofluidParticles` ships own conformer (does NOT extend `ProceduralGeometry`). (5) **D-099 / DM.2 Common.metal struct extension intact** — FeatureVector first 32 floats + StemFeatures first 16 floats byte-identical to original DM.0 layout; preset-side preamble at `PresetLoader+Preamble.swift:34-128` matches the Swift-side `@frozen FeatureVector` + `StemFeatures` declarations. (6) **Drift Motes / D-102 retirement clean** — no DriftMotes files, JSON sidecars, PresetCategory cases, or `motes_update` kernel references. (7) **FidelityRubric ↔ SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.1 aligned** — M1 (detail cascade), M2 (≥4 octaves), M3 (≥3 distinct materials), M4 (D-026 deviation + no absolute thresholds), M5 (silence-fallback runtime), M6 (perf budget), M7 (always manual). One clarification: **pale-tone-share ≤ 0.30 (D-LM-cream-rescission) is NOT enforced as a rubric item** — handled exclusively by M7 manual review.

**BUG-016 producer-side characterisation.** Read `LumenPatternEngine.swift` + `LumenMosaicPaletteLibrary.swift` end-to-end. **Candidate root cause filed as BUG-016 addendum:** `LumenPatternEngine.init?(device:seed:)` returns nil on `device.makeBuffer(length: 568, options: .storageModeShared)` failure without any logging from the Presets-module-internal side (the App-side `applyPreset` consumes the nil with an `os.Logger.error(...)` to `com.phosphene.app` category, but that line does NOT reach session.log). Mapping the 5 BUG-016 candidate failure modes: Mode 1 (black/blank) — plausible Swift-side instrumentation gap; Mode 4 (no audio response) — known LM.4.3 limitation (no FFT fallback if `f.beatPhase01` never wraps); Modes 2/3/5 are out of Swift scope (App-layer apply path / shader compilation / palette-library color analysis). Filed **CA-Presets-FU-4** for the `Logging.session?.log(...)` instrumentation upgrade.

**Notable doc-drift findings.** (a) **`LumenPatternState` stride is 568 bytes, not 376** as ARCHITECTURE.md still claims at line 623 (LM.4.7 added the 192-byte `palette[12]` tuple for the curated palette library; the `trackPaletteSeed{A,B,C,D}` LM.7 chromatic-tint fields became zeroed dead-weight ABI continuity). Fixed in this increment. (b) **Stalker entries in ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map (lines 616-618) refer to deleted files** — `Shaders/Stalker.metal` + `Stalker/StalkerGait.swift` + `Stalker/StalkerState.swift` were all removed in Increment 3.5.7 (retired in favour of the 3D ray-march SDF spider easter egg inside Arachne). Fixed in this increment with a single retirement note. (c) **`Lumen/LumenPatterns.swift`** referenced at ARCH line 624 — deleted at LM.4.4; leaving inline note as historical. (d) **Eighteen missing files** in ARCH §Module Map Presets/ block — bundled into CA-Audio-FU-9 (Module Map Sync) per the kickoff bundling rule (>3 missing files defer to FU-9). (e) **`LumenMosaic.json` carries a `"lumen_mosaic": {...}` configuration block** (cell_density, cell_jitter, frost_amplitude, etc.) that is NOT decoded by PresetDescriptor — dead JSON. Filed as **CA-Presets-FU-2** (recommend remove). (f) **`AuroraVeil.json "passes": []`** empty-array semantics is intentional per AV.2.2 mv_warp drop, but documented only via inline shader comment at `AuroraVeil.metal:537-541`; arguably should be `"passes": ["direct"]`. Filed as **CA-Presets-FU-1** (cosmetic).

**Five follow-ups filed (CA-Presets-FU-1 through CA-Presets-FU-5):** FU-1 cosmetic AuroraVeil.json clarity; FU-2 LumenMosaic.json dead config block; FU-3 retire `GossamerState.lcg(_:)` dead helper (comment says "kept for future Stalker extraction" — Stalker retired in Increment 3.5.7); FU-4 add `Logging.session?.log(...)` for LumenPatternEngine init-failure instrumentation (depends on Matt's BUG-016 reproduction); FU-5 add code-comment in FidelityRubric+Mandatory.swift documenting pale-tone-share is M7-manual-only.

**Doc-drift fixes landed in this increment:** ARCH §Module Map line 623 `LumenPatternState` size 376 → 568 + LM.4.7 history annotation extended; ARCH §Module Map lines 616-618 Stalker entries removed + replaced with single retirement note; ARCH §Module Map adds `Lumen/LumenMosaicPaletteLibrary.swift` entry (LM.4.7 curated palette library). KNOWN_ISSUES.md BUG-016 body extended with addendum noting LumenPatternEngine init-failure silent-nil + recommended logging upgrade.

**Approach validation:** the per-cluster split (infrastructure / per-preset state / certification) gave a natural unit-of-audit progression. Pre-grep visibility verification (CA.5+ refinement) caught zero discrepancies. The non-nil-caller production-orphan check (CA.7b refinement) was not load-bearing here — all setter / mutator APIs on per-preset state classes have non-nil callers from `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`. ARCH §Module Map drift is now a **6-in-a-row systemic finding** across CA.5/6/7a/7b/CA-Audio/CA-Presets — bundles into CA-Audio-FU-9. The kickoff's "3,129 LoC" scope claim was off by 3× (actual: 9,175 LoC) — Pass 0 verification caught this immediately. **Recommended next subsystem: CA-Shared** (`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Shared/` — the last remaining unaudited engine surface; cross-cuts every other module via FeatureVector / StemFeatures / SceneUniforms / TrackMetadata types; expected smaller than CA-Audio at ~8-12 files). Alternative: CA-Audio-FU-9 (Module Map Sync) if cumulative drift warrants prioritisation. Alternative: a `.metal` shader audit increment (CA-Preset-Shaders) — methodology-distinct from capability-registry verdicts; would need a Pass 0 split decision.

### CA-Audio-FU-2 (LookaheadBuffer kept) + CA-Audio-FU-3 (MusicKitFetcher kept) + CA-Audio-FU-9 (Module Map Sync filed) ✅ (2026-05-21)

Three same-day follow-up resolutions after CA-Audio's audit closeout, all under Matt's direction:

- **CA-Audio-FU-2 — keep LookaheadBuffer.** Matt's product call: **KEEP** as Phase MV anticipatory-architecture infrastructure. Planned consumers: (a) Orchestrator anticipatory preset transitions (switch fired 2.5 s ahead so mv_warp crossfade lands ON the structural boundary instead of after — the difference between "the visualizer chases the music" and "the visualizer rides the music"); (b) drop-anticipation visual telegraphing (windup animation triggered by build-up detection ahead of the drop); (c) beat-aligned transitions to the exact frame via BeatGrid downbeat scheduling; (d) Phase MV / MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE.md musicality requires anticipation. Structurally analogous to CA.7-FU-3 ICB-keep + CA.7b-FU-3 RayTracing-keep precedents. ARCH §Module Map Audio/ LookaheadBuffer entry updated to reflect kept-by-design status with planned consumers listed.
- **CA-Audio-FU-3 — keep MusicKitFetcher.** Matt's product call: **KEEP** as the Apple Music first-class metadata path. Planned consumers: (a) wire into `buildFetcherList()` for Apple Music users (gives ~half the macOS audience a higher-quality metadata path than the current MusicBrainz fallback); (b) direct-catalog-API path for tempo via `https://api.music.apple.com/v1/catalog/{storefront}/songs/{id}` (the underlying REST API exposes `tempo`; only the Swift wrapper doesn't surface it — the fetcher would URLSession-call this with the user's MusicKit developer token); (c) future-proof against Apple closing the SDK gap (`fetchBPM` stub becomes a one-line replacement when `Song.tempo` ships); (d) scaffolding for queue-awareness (Apple Music playlists, library, Now Playing queue — pre-warming next preset based on next-track metadata). Structurally analogous to CA.7-FU-3 + CA.7b-FU-3 keep precedents. File/type name mismatch (`MusicKitBridge.swift` contains `MusicKitFetcher`) noted separately as cosmetic — recommend renaming the file to `MusicKitFetcher.swift` in a future cleanup. ARCH §Module Map Audio/ MusicKitBridge entry updated.
- **CA-Audio-FU-9 — file Module Map Sync as a planned increment.** The ARCH §Module Map drift is now a **5-in-a-row systemic finding** (CA.5 / CA.6 / CA.7a / CA.7b / CA-Audio all surfaced module-map drift). Per-increment overhead is small; cumulative drift is large; the same problem recurs every audit. Filed as a standalone registry+doc-only increment that will run `find PhospheneEngine/Sources PhospheneApp -name '*.swift' | sort` against every §Module Map block in ARCH (including Tests/) in one pass. Not blocking CA-Presets — CA-Presets can land first and bundle any further Presets/ drift into the sync pass. Estimate 1 session.

Verification: no code changes (registry-only). `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/AUDIO.md` updated: Summary verdict count for production-orphan reframed as "production-orphan (kept-by-design) — 2 files" with planned-consumer rationale per file; Follow-up Backlog rows for CA-Audio-FU-2 + CA-Audio-FU-3 marked Resolved with Matt's keep rationale + planned-consumer list; CA-Audio-FU-9 added to backlog. ARCH §Module Map Audio/ LookaheadBuffer + MusicKitBridge entries extended with kept-by-design annotation + planned-consumer rationale. CA-Audio's headline LookaheadBuffer finding (1-of-1 doc-level broken-but-claimed) remains addressed (ARCH §Audio Capture diagram correction landed in the closeout).

### CA-Audio — Audio Capability Audit ✅ (2026-05-21)

Ninth per-subsystem audit pass under Phase CA. Produced [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/AUDIO.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/AUDIO.md) — 16 files / 3,294 Swift LoC covering the capture pipeline (Audio.swift module marker + AudioBuffer + AudioInputRouter + AudioInputRouter+SignalState + SystemAudioCapture + FFTProcessor + LookaheadBuffer), signal-quality monitors (SilenceDetector + InputLevelMonitor), metadata fetcher cluster (MetadataPreFetcher + MusicBrainzFetcher + SpotifyFetcher + SoundchartsFetcher + MusicKitBridge), streaming poll (StreamingMetadata), and the Protocols.swift surface. Single-pass audit (direct-read all 16 files in two parallel batches; no Explore agents needed at 3.3k LoC).

**Headline findings: 13 of 16 files `production-active`; 2 file-level `production-orphan` (LookaheadBuffer + MusicKitBridge/MusicKitFetcher); 3 field-level `production-orphan` (AudioInputRouter.onAnalysisFrame + .onRenderFrame + FFTProcessor.printHistogram); 1 method-level `stub` (MusicKitFetcher.fetchBPM always returns nil — MusicKit Swift SDK does not expose tempo); 1 doc-level `broken-but-claimed` (ARCH §Audio Capture diagram line 40 claims LookaheadBuffer in pipeline — code never wires it; fixed in this increment); zero `broken-but-claimed` at the code level; zero new BUG entries.**

**All four kickoff-required verifications landed clean.** (1) **D-079 sample-rate plumbing clean** — `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` exits 0; literal `44100` grep in Sources/Audio returns 2 hits both in Protocols.swift:111 doc-comment (CI gate correctly ignores comment lines); tap-sample-rate immutably captured via the `(rate: Float)` IO-proc callback arg + App-side NSLock-guarded `_tapSampleRate` storage (CA.5 chain). (2) **Tap recovery state machine matches ARCH §68 byte-for-byte** — `reinstallDelays: [TimeInterval] = [3.0, 10.0, 30.0]` at AudioInputRouter.swift:70; three attempts; cancel-on-active; re-check `silenceDetector.state == .silent` before performing the install; lock-guarded mutation of `reinstallAttempts` + `reinstallWorkItem`. **Gap: zero dedicated tests for the reinstall logic** (filed CA-Audio-FU-4). (3) **SilenceDetector + InputLevelMonitor timings match ARCH §487-488** — SilenceDetector defaults silenceDuration=3.0s / suspectDuration=1.5s (= silenceDuration/2) / recoveryDuration=0.5s; InputLevelMonitor peakEnvelope decay 0.9995/update at ~94 Hz → 21.3s time constant (math derivation in audit doc); hysteresis gradeSwitchFrames=30; peak-only classification post-2026-04-17T21-05-47Z. **Gap: no InputLevelMonitorTests.swift** (filed CA-Audio-FU-5). (4) **Failed Approach #21 + #22 verified clean at SystemAudioCapture** — buildTapDescription uses `stereoGlobalTapButExcludeProcesses: []` for .systemAudio (line 256) and `stereoMixdownOfProcesses: [AudioObjectID(PID)]` non-empty array for .application (line 269; FA #21 prohibits only the empty-array form). `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()` lives in App's `VisualizerEngine+PublicAPI.swift:21` per the single-request-point invariant documented at `Permissions/ScreenCapturePermissionProvider.swift:2`.

**CA.3 Session ↔ Audio boundary-noted item closes here.** Full producer-side trace of MetadataPreFetcher: `init(fetchers:timeoutSeconds:maxCacheSize:)` defaults 3s + 50; `prefetch(for:) async` parallel withTaskGroup + LRU promote-on-hit; `cachedProfile(for:)` sync lookup; `merge(_:)` first-non-nil-wins. Session-side consumers at `SessionPreparer.swift:86, 132, 299` confirmed. **CA.3 SESSION.md line 145 correction landed in this increment:** `TrackMetadata` lives in `Sources/Shared/AudioFeatures+Metadata.swift:30`, NOT in Audio — same for `PreFetchedTrackProfile` (line 69) + `MetadataSource` (line 10). MetadataPreFetcher itself does live in Audio.

**LookaheadBuffer is the audit's load-bearing finding.** ARCH §Audio Capture diagram (line 40) claims `→ LookaheadBuffer (2.5s analysis/render split)` is part of the live capture pipeline. Code: **zero production instantiations.** `AudioInputRouter.onAnalysisFrame` (line 113) + `.onRenderFrame` (line 117) are the wire callbacks that would source the lookahead — both declared but never assigned in production. `TransitionPolicy.swift:134` doc-comment claims "Matches the LookaheadBuffer delay of 2.5 s" — that's coincidental, not coupled. Same structural shape as CA.7b's RayTracing finding (production-active code, zero production consumers, planned for future use). Filed as **CA-Audio-FU-2** for Matt's product call (wire / keep as infrastructure / retire); ARCH diagram annotated as planned-but-unwired in this increment.

**Kickoff staleness: BUG-005 attribution.** Kickoff claimed BUG-005 (Spotify preview_url null) was "Audio-module-internal; SpotifyFetcher producer-side." Verification: Audio's `SpotifyFetcher.swift:122-147` calls `/v1/search` returning only `(id, duration_ms)` — no preview_url field exists in the Audio data path. Actual BUG-005 producer is the **Session-layer** `SpotifyWebAPIConnector.swift:241` (extracts `preview_url` from /items endpoint) consumed by `PreviewResolver.swift:73`. Both Session-side files were audited at the Session module surface in CA.3. KNOWN_ISSUES.md BUG-005 body itself is correct (it references PreviewResolver); only the kickoff prompt asserted the wrong domain. Registry-only correction filed as **CA-Audio-FU-1**.

**MusicKitFetcher is fully orphan.** Public class in `MusicKitBridge.swift` (file/type name mismatch — minor). Zero production instantiations (not in `buildFetcherList()` which composes MusicBrainz + Soundcharts/Spotify env-gated + App-side ITunesSearchFetcher), zero test sites. Core feature `fetchBPM(for:)` is a stub (MusicKit Swift SDK does not expose tempo per in-code comment; method always returns nil). Even if wired, would only duplicate MusicBrainz's genre + duration coverage. Filed as **CA-Audio-FU-3** for Matt's product call (recommend delete per the "if 'reusable infrastructure' appears in defense" check from CA.7b precedent).

**Eight follow-ups filed (CA-Audio-FU-1 through CA-Audio-FU-8):** FU-1 resolved in this audit (kickoff-staleness correction); FU-2 Matt product call on LookaheadBuffer; FU-3 Matt product call on MusicKitFetcher; FU-4 tap-reinstall tests; FU-5 InputLevelMonitor tests; FU-6 retire FFTProcessor.printHistogram; FU-7 tighten MoodClassifying docstring (10-floats-per-frame × 2 = 20 total); FU-8 RUNBOOK §Spotify connector setup disambiguate Session OAuth vs Audio client-credentials.

**Doc-drift fixes landed in this increment:** ARCH §Audio Capture diagram (line 40 LookaheadBuffer arrow → annotated as planned-but-unwired with comment-block pointer to CA-Audio audit); ARCH §Module Map Audio/ block extended with the 2 missing files (`Audio.swift` module marker + `AudioInputRouter+SignalState.swift` extension) and 6 entries annotated with CA-Audio findings (LookaheadBuffer production-orphan, MusicKitBridge production-orphan, plus production-active annotations matching the audit verdicts); CA.3 SESSION.md line 145 corrected (TrackMetadata lives in Shared, not Audio).

**Approach validation:** direct-read at 3.3k LoC scaled cleanly (no Explore agents); Pass 0 BUG-status cross-check caught the BUG-005 attribution kickoff staleness; non-nil-caller production-orphan check (CA.7b refinement) fired correctly for the LookaheadBuffer callbacks (file-level orphan check alone would have missed because AudioInputRouter itself is heavily production-active). **The ARCH Module Map drift is now a 5-in-a-row systemic finding** across CA.5/6/7a/7b/CA-Audio — recommend filing a standalone module-map sync increment running `find PhospheneEngine/Sources PhospheneApp -name '*.swift' | sort` against the ARCH Module Map blocks in one pass. **Recommended next subsystem: CA-Presets** (per-preset state classes under `Sources/Presets/` + .metal shader files — last remaining unaudited engine module; expect to need a Pass 0 split decision: state classes vs. shader files). Alternative: **CA-Shared** (smallest natural next pass after CA-Presets; declared deferred indefinitely per CA-Audio kickoff but now the only other unaudited engine surface).

### CA.7b-FU-3 (RayTracing kept) + CA-Audio kickoff ✅ (2026-05-21)

Matt's product call on CA.7b-FU-3: **keep RayTracing infrastructure**. Rationale: *"it will be used eventually by presets we haven't created yet"* — D-096 Arachne3D toolkit citation + V.8.7+ BVH refraction documented planned consumers, plus future ray-tracing-using presets not yet specced. Registry-only resolution (no code change); `RENDERER_SUPPORTING.md` CA.7b-FU-3 row marked Resolved with Matt's rationale. Structurally analogous to CA.7-FU-3 ICB-keep precedent. ARCH §Module Map lines 561-562 already extended in the CA.7b doc-drift commit with production-orphan + planned-consumer notes; no further ARCH changes needed.

In the same session, **CA-Audio kickoff prompt landed** ([`docs/prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA_AUDIO_2026-05-21.md`](prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA_AUDIO_2026-05-21.md)) — recommended next subsystem per CA.7b closeout. Closes the CA.3 Session ↔ Audio boundary-noted item (`MetadataPreFetcher` producer-side); covers 16 files / 3,294 LoC (capture pipeline + signal-quality monitors + metadata fetcher cluster + protocols + module marker). Audit itself pending Matt's scheduling.

### CA.7b — Renderer Capability Audit (Dashboard / Geometry / RayTracing) ✅ (2026-05-21)

Eighth per-subsystem audit pass under Phase CA — closes the Renderer subsystem fully (CA.7a covered the core dispatch path; CA.7b covers the supporting modules). Produced [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/RENDERER_SUPPORTING.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/RENDERER_SUPPORTING.md) — 15 files / 2,241 Swift LoC. **All four kickoff-required verifications complete**: (1) DASH.7 producer-side **clean against D-087 / D-088 / D-089 + CA.6's 16 line-anchored view-side confirmations** — full producer chain trace from `VisualizerEngine+Dashboard.publishDashboardSnapshot` through `@Published var dashboardSnapshot` + Combine `.throttle(33 ms)` into the three Builders, each with per-row D-088/D-089 colour + contrast confirmations (MODE/BPM/BAR/BEAT for BeatCard; DRUMS/BASS/VOCALS/OTHER timeseries for StemsCard; FRAME always + QUALITY/ML conditional for PerfCard); 280pt card width consistent; 33 ms throttle matches `DashboardSnapshot` doc-comment; 240-sample `StemEnergyHistory.capacity` matches view-model ring buffer. (2) D-097 particle-geometry siblings **clean** — `ParticleGeometry` protocol surface (AnyObject + Sendable, 3 required members: `activeParticleFraction`/`update(features:stemFeatures:commandBuffer:)`/`render(encoder:features:)`) matches D-097 spec at `ParticleGeometry.swift:33-79`; storage typed as `(any ParticleGeometry)?` at `RenderPipeline.swift:31`; `ProceduralGeometry` zero parameterisation hits (no `presetName`/`kernelOverride`/etc., CLAUDE.md §What NOT To Do invariant respected); `ParticleGeometryRegistry.knownPresetNames = ["Murmuration"]` sole entry post-Drift Motes retirement (D-102); `ParticleDispatchRegistryTests` catalog gate working. (3) MeshGenerator D-051 dispatch **clean** — `device.supportsFamily(.apple8)` Apple silicon family gate at init + `usesMeshShaderPath` branch at every draw call; mesh path uses `drawMeshThreadgroups` with per-meshlet thread counts (M3+); fallback path uses `drawPrimitives(.triangle, count: 3)` fullscreen-triangle (M1/M2); slot-4 mesh-shader path reuse per CA.7a's ARCH extension confirmed (MeshGenerator binds only slot 0 FeatureVector + slot 1 densityMultiplier; fragment slot 4's `meshPresetFragmentBuffer` is RenderPipeline+MeshDraw's binding territory, not MeshGenerator's). Only mesh-shader-using preset today is **Fractal Tree** (`Presets/Shaders/FractalTree.json:7`). (4) RayTracing **`production-orphan` + `boundary-noted`** — **zero production consumers** across `PhospheneApp/` + `PhospheneEngine/Sources/` (only test consumers `BVHBuilderTests` + `RayIntersectorTests` plus one pure documentation cross-reference at `Sources/Shared/AudioFeatures+SceneUniforms.swift:9`); planned consumer is `Arachne3D` per D-096 V.8.0-spec (V.8.x deferred per Matt's 2026-05-08 sequencing call — V.8.1 row in ENGINEERING_PLAN.md unstarted; BVH refraction explicitly deferred past V.8.7 per D-096 Decision 3). Recommended **keep-by-design** analogous to CA.7-FU-3's ICB resolution — filed as **CA.7b-FU-3** for Matt's keep/retire decision. **Cross-reference finding (CA.7a-scope, surfaced from CA.7b inspection)**: `setMeshPresetBuffer(_:)` + `setMeshPresetFragmentBuffer(_:)` have **zero non-nil production callers** — the only call site is the `pipeline.setMeshPresetBuffer(nil)` reset at `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:55`. Latent slot-1 collision: RenderPipeline+MeshDraw.swift:65-67 binds `meshPresetBuffer` at object/mesh slot 1 (if non-nil), then MeshGenerator.draw() lines 204-205 overwrite slot 1 with `densityMultiplier` (last-write-wins). Today no live bug (no non-nil caller exists). Filed as **CA.7b-FU-4** with recommended deprecate-and-remove (CA.7-FU-4 `setRayMarchPresetComputeDispatch` retirement precedent). **Doc-drift fixes landed in this increment**: ARCH §Module Map Renderer/Dashboard/ block had stale `DashboardTextLayer` (line 564) + `DashboardCardRenderer` (line 566) entries despite DASH.7 retirement (D-087) — both deleted; ARCH §Module Map Renderer/Geometry/ block missed `ParticleGeometryRegistry` — inserted with one-line behavioural description; ARCH §Renderer/Dashboard/PerfSnapshot line 569 incorrectly claimed `forceDispatchCount` field — rewritten as decision-code + retry-ms; ARCH §Module Map Renderer/Dashboard/`DashboardCardLayout` (line 565) extended with `.timeseries` row variant + sparkline height; `DashboardFontLoader` (line 563) extended with Clash Display + system-fallback semantics; ARCH RayTracing entries (lines 561-562) extended with production-orphan + planned-consumer notes. **Zero new BUG entries filed**; **zero broken-but-claimed**. **Approach validation:** direct-read at 2.2k LoC scaled cleanly without Explore agents; the "non-nil caller" production-orphan check at setter granularity is a new pattern worth carrying forward — CA.7a verified setters as production-active because any caller existed; CA.7b's slot-1 discovery happened because non-nil callers were checked specifically. ARCH §Module Map drift is now a **4-in-a-row systemic finding** across CA.5/6/7a/7b — recommend a future bulk pass against `find` output rather than continuing one-or-two-items-per-increment. **Recommended next subsystem: CA-Audio** (`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/` — closes the CA.3 boundary-noted item). Alternative: CA-Presets (per-preset state classes under Sources/Presets/). Renderer is now fully audited (CA.7a core + CA.7b supporting = 38 files / 7,654 LoC); the only remaining unaudited engine modules are Audio + Presets.

### CA.7-FU-3 (kept) + CA.7-FU-4 (retired) follow-ups ✅ (2026-05-21)

Two product calls landed same-day after CA.7a's audit closeout, both under Matt's direction:

- **CA.7-FU-3 — keep ICB cluster.** Matt's product call: keep. ICB infrastructure (`RenderPipeline+ICB.swift`, `RenderPass.icb`, `ICB.metal`, `IndirectCommandBufferState`, App-side `case .icb:` no-op + log at `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:303-306`, `RenderPipelineICBTests`) stays in place — test-active but production-orphan, awaiting a future preset that declares `"icb"` in its passes list. No code change; registry-only resolution.
- **CA.7-FU-4 — retire `setRayMarchPresetComputeDispatch(_:)`.** Matt's product call: retire. Code removed across 4 files: `RenderPipeline.swift` (the `RayMarchPresetComputeDispatch` typealias + `rayMarchPresetComputeDispatch` storage + `rayMarchPresetComputeDispatchLock` + the V.9 Session 4.5b Phase 2b MARK header + doc-comment block); `RenderPipeline+PresetSwitching.swift` (the public `setRayMarchPresetComputeDispatch(_:)` setter + its doc-comment); `RenderPipeline+RayMarch.swift` (the per-frame `computeDispatch` snapshot at line 143 + the `if let dispatch = computeDispatch { dispatch(...) }` call site at lines 170-172 + the "Phase 2b" comment block); `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` (the `pipeline.setRayMarchPresetComputeDispatch(nil)` reset call at line 71 + the "intentionally NOT set" comment block at lines 264-266). The closure was kept-by-design for a Ferrofluid Ocean Phase 2b revival that was deactivated at Phase 1 round 4 ("particles are pinned, one-shot bake at preset apply is sufficient"); no consumer materialised in 6+ months. If a future ray-march preset needs per-frame compute, re-introduce the API at that time.

Verification: `swift build --package-path PhospheneEngine` → Build complete (10.73s). `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp build` → BUILD SUCCEEDED. Engine test suite: 1,248 tests across 162 suites — all passing. App test suite: 328 tests across 60 suites — all passing. `swiftlint lint --strict` → 0 violations / 371 files. Audit doc updated: `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/RENDERER.md` CA.7-FU-3 + CA.7-FU-4 rows marked Resolved with Matt's product-call rationale; Summary §Verdict counts table updated (`production-orphan` 2 → 1 after CA.7-FU-4 retirement).

### CA.7a — Renderer Capability Audit (core pipeline) ✅ (2026-05-21)

Seventh per-subsystem audit pass under Phase CA (closed by the CA.7a half of the CA.7 split). Produced [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/RENDERER.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/RENDERER.md) — 23 files / 5,413 Swift LoC covering the load-bearing per-frame render dispatch path. **All five kickoff-required verifications landed clean**: GPU contract slot reservations (9 buffer + 9 texture slots match code byte-for-byte; slot 12 DynamicTextOverlay + slot 13+ staged sampled outputs surfaced as built-but-undocumented and added to ARCH §GPU Contract Details); MLDispatchScheduler D-059 5-rule algorithm + Tier 1/2 deferral caps (2000ms/30 + 1500ms/20); FrameBudgetManager 30-frame rolling window + 180-frame upshift hysteresis + 14ms/16ms per-tier targets (the BUG-011-closure-load-bearing spec); mv_warp dispatch path against D-027; Failed Approach #66 test/prod parity (the `useMeshPath` fixture parameter). **One dead-code cluster** (CA.7-FU-2 — `depthDebugEnabled`/`runDepthDebugPass`/`depthDebugPipeline`) and **two production-orphan clusters** (CA.7-FU-3 ICB infrastructure deferred per VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:305 comment; CA.7-FU-4 `setRayMarchPresetComputeDispatch` kept-by-design after Phase 1 round-4 deactivation). **One marginal parity finding** — AuroraVeilMVWarpAccumulationTest reimplements the 3-pass mv_warp sequence rather than calling `RenderPipeline.drawWithMVWarp(...)` directly (CA.7-FU-1; the test exercises an equivalent path but not the live helper letter-for-letter). **Doc drifts fixed in this increment**: ARCH §Renderer line 184-185 buffer summary was inverted + claimed 4-7 future — rewritten to canonical order with slot 4/5/6/7/8 assignments noted; ARCH §Module Map Renderer/ block extended with 7 missing files (RenderPipeline+FeedbackDraw / +Staged / +BudgetGovernor / +PresetSwitching, RayMarchPipeline+PipelineStates, DynamicTextOverlay, Protocols); ARCH §GPU Contract Details extended with slot 12, slot 13+, and slot 4 mesh-shader path reuse note. **Zero new BUG entries filed**; every load-bearing claim in CLAUDE.md / ARCHITECTURE.md / DECISIONS.md matches the code. **Approach validation:** hybrid direct-read (16 files) + 1 parallel Explore agent (9 files) scaled cleanly at 5.4k LoC; the kickoff's "22 files / 7.5k LoC" estimate was +1 file low and 38 % LoC over — future kickoff drafters should `wc -l` the scope first; the methodology stays. Next subsystem: **CA.7b** (Dashboard / Geometry / RayTracing — 15 files / 2,241 LoC) closes Renderer fully. Alternative: CA-Audio (smaller; closes the CA.3 boundary-noted item).

### CA.5-FU-2 + CA.6-FU-1 + CA.6-FU-2 + CA.6-FU-3 follow-ups ✅ (2026-05-21)

Four small App-layer doc + architectural-consistency follow-ups landed same-day after CA.6's audit closeout, all under Matt's product-call direction:

- **CA.5-FU-2** — `LiveAdaptationToastBridge.swift` docstring rewrite (Matt's product call: **stay invisible**). Engine-driven adaptations do NOT toast; toast surface is reserved for user-initiated keystroke acknowledgements per UX_SPEC §7.4 ("on keystroke"). File-header at lines 1-15 + class-level doc at lines 22-26 rewritten to drop the "engine events" observation source and clarify `emitAck(_:)` is for user-action acks only. No behavioural change.
- **CA.6-FU-1** — `DashboardOverlayView.swift:10` file-header docstring drift fix. "0.55α" → "0.96α" with rationale rewording to match the existing lower-block "near-opaque … WCAG AA contrast" explanation at lines 50-56. Code at line 57 unchanged.
- **CA.6-FU-2** — `DashboardCardView.swift:5` file-header docstring drift fix. "Clash Display title at 18pt" → token-anchored phrasing "Clash Display Medium title at `DashboardTokens.TypeScale.bodyLarge` (15 pt) relative to `.title3`". Code unchanged.
- **CA.6-FU-3** — `ConnectorPickerView.swift` architectural consistency. Extracted `private struct AppleMusicConnectionWrapper: View` mirroring the existing `OAuthSpotifyConnectionWrapper` shape: holds `@StateObject private var viewModel = AppleMusicConnectionViewModel()` so the VM (and its in-flight 2 s auto-retry Task) survives `ConnectorPickerView` body re-evaluations triggered by `viewModel.appleMusicRunning` changes from the NSWorkspace launch/terminate observers. `destination(for: .appleMusic)` now builds the wrapper instead of constructing the VM inline. Defensive against the same class of body-re-eval VM-orphaning the Spotify wrapper was originally written to prevent.

Verification: `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp build` → BUILD SUCCEEDED. `swiftlint lint --strict` → 0 violations / 371 files. No new tests required (3 are doc-only edits; the wrapper is a structural pattern match with no observable surface change in the common case). Audit docs updated: `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP.md` CA.5-FU-2 row marked Resolved; `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP_VIEWS.md` CA.6-FU-1/2/3 rows marked Resolved.

### Increment CA.6 — App-Layer Capability Audit (Views + ViewModels presentation slice) ✅ (2026-05-21)

Sixth per-subsystem audit under Phase CA. Produced [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP_VIEWS.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP_VIEWS.md) — 59 files / 8,285 LoC covering the App-layer presentation slice: `PhospheneApp/Views/` (47 files across 9 subdirectories + root-level) + `PhospheneApp/ViewModels/` (12 files), plus `DashboardOverlayViewModel.swift` which lives in `Views/Dashboard/` per the filesystem layout. The kickoff's ~6,889 LoC estimate undercounted by ~20%; methodology unaffected. Headline findings: **58 of 59 files `production-active`; zero `broken-but-claimed`; zero new BUG entries filed**. **PlaybackChromeViewModel BUG-015 / D-091 / QR.4 consumer chain verified clean** — full producer-to-consumer trace from `VisualizerEngine.swift:77` through `+Capture.swift:152` through `ContentView.swift:85` (publisher binding) through `PlaybackView.swift:74,90` (init relay) into `PlaybackChromeViewModel.swift:121,169-176` (publisher subscription) and `:242-254` (`refreshProgress()` direct consumer); no lowercased title+artist string matching anywhere; `grep -rnE "lowercased\(\).*title|lowercased\(\).*artist" PhospheneApp/ViewModels PhospheneApp/Views` returns zero hits. **D-091 single-SettingsStore enforcement verified clean across the entire View tree** — ONE legitimate `@StateObject SettingsStore()` at `PhospheneApp.swift:25`; ONE `@EnvironmentObject SettingsStore` consumer at `PlaybackView.swift:55`; all four Settings sub-sections (`AboutSettingsSection`, `AudioSettingsSection`, `DiagnosticsSettingsSection`, `VisualsSettingsSection`) take `SettingsViewModel` as `@ObservedObject`; SettingsView's custom `init(store:)` builds the VM as `@StateObject(wrappedValue: SettingsViewModel(store: store))` (correct D-091 topology). **DASH.7 dashboard surface verified clean against D-088 / D-089** — 16 line-anchored confirmations: DarkVibrancyView backdrop (`.vibrantDark` + `.hudWindow`), 0.96α surface tint, 1px border stroke, `.environment(\.colorScheme, .dark)` lock, 320pt width, throttle 33ms (~30Hz), `ingestForTest(_:)` test seam, 240-sample stem history per stem, `.singleValue` D-089 inline form (label-left, 13pt mono right, frame height 17pt), `.progressBar` value column 110pt with `.fixedSize(horizontal: true)`, no SF Symbols (status via valueText color), Clash Display Medium 15pt title, Epilogue Medium 11pt + 1.5 tracking labels, asymmetric transition + spring-choreographed toggle from PlaybackView. **U.10 / U.11 timing-margin compliance verified clean across all 9 widened App-test files** from the `[dev-2026-05-21-c]` + `[dev-2026-05-21-d]` chip (`AppleMusicConnectionViewModelTests`, `LiveAdaptationToastBridgeTests`, `NetworkRecoveryCoordinatorTests`, `PlaybackChromeViewModelTests`, `ReadyViewModelTests`, `ReadyViewTimeoutIntegrationTests`, `SpotifyConnectionViewModelTests`, `SpotifyOAuthTokenProviderTests`, `ToastManagerTests`) — every margin meets or exceeds U.11 baselines (700ms wait for 300ms debounce; 250-400ms for connect/login async actor-hop completions); `@Suite(.serialized)` annotation present on both URLProtocol/keychain-stub-using suites (SpotifyOAuthTokenProviderTests line 99, SpotifyKeychainStoreTests line 9). **3 `unverified-claim` findings**: (1) `DashboardOverlayView.swift:10` file-header docstring claims "0.55α" surface tint but code at line 57 uses `.opacity(0.96)` — drift INSIDE the file's own docstring (ARCHITECTURE.md / D-089 correctly say 0.96α; CA.6-FU-1). (2) `DashboardCardView.swift:5` file-header claims "Clash Display title at 18pt" but code resolves `DashboardTokens.TypeScale.bodyLarge` which is `15` — drift INSIDE the file's own docstring (ARCHITECTURE.md correctly says 15pt; CA.6-FU-2). (3) `ConnectorPickerView.swift:111-115` creates `AppleMusicConnectionViewModel()` inline in the `@ViewBuilder` destination for `.appleMusic` while the equivalent Spotify path uses an `OAuthSpotifyConnectionWrapper` `@StateObject` to preserve the VM across parent body re-evaluations — architectural inconsistency between AM and Spotify (CA.6-FU-3); production impact likely low (AM has no URL-callback foregrounding scenario), but worth either applying the wrapper pattern for consistency or documenting the rationale. **2 large `built-but-undocumented`**: (a) ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map PhospheneApp/Views/ block listed ~20 of 47 files (27 missing) + 3 §UI Layer paragraph drift items (NoAudioSignalBadge → ListeningBadgeView rename in U.6; missing Shift+→/Shift+←/Z/M/Esc/Shift+? shortcuts per U.6b + UX_SPEC §7.7; DashboardOverlayView Layer 6 not mentioned); (b) §Module Map PhospheneApp/ViewModels/ block listed 4 of 12 (8 missing). Same systemic pattern as CA.1 / CA.2 / CA.3 / CA.4 / CA.5. **No `production-orphan` findings** — every public/internal type, every method has a production consumer (two candidates investigated and rejected: `AppleMusicConnectionViewModel.cancelRetry()` consumed at `AppleMusicConnectionView.swift:33` on view disappear; `ReadyViewModel.planPreviewEnabled` consumed at `ReadyView.swift:142-143`). **CA.5-FU-1 + CA.5-FU-3 landed before CA.6 began** (commits `688095d4` MultiDisplayToastBridge dead-field cleanup + `b8952fda` MusicKitFetcher → ITunesSearchFetcher rename per kickoff status-on-entry); CA.5-FU-2 (LiveAdaptationToastBridge engine-event docstring product call) remains pending — carried forward to next App-adjacent increment. Doc-drift corrections applied to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§UI Layer paragraph: NoAudioSignalBadge → ListeningBadgeView; keyboard-shortcut list extended with U.6b additions; DashboardOverlayView Layer 6 added; PlaybackView ownership topology updated to reflect 4 @StateObject ViewModels + 8 @State services + 2 @EnvironmentObject; §Module Map PhospheneApp/Views/ block extended with all 47 files at one-line behavioural granularity; §Module Map PhospheneApp/ViewModels/ block extended with all 12 ViewModels). **Approach validation:** direct reads + 3 parallel Explore agents scaled cleanly for 8.3k LoC (kickoff's 6.9k estimate ~20% low — future kickoff drafters should `wc -l` the scope first); D-091 enforcement grep produced confidence in one shot; PlaybackChromeViewModel consumer-chain trace produced 10 byte-level confirmations matching the design; DASH.7 verification produced 16 line-anchored confirmations against D-088 / D-089; the U.10/U.11 table-based audit produced complete per-file compliance verdicts. **The format continues to produce actionable findings**: 3 small follow-ups (two file-header docstring drifts + one architectural-consistency question), 1 optional doc-promotion (CA.6-FU-4), 1 CA.5-FU-2 carry-forward, plus the four kickoff-required verifications all clean. **Recommended next subsystem: CA.7 — CA-Renderer** (`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/` is the largest unaudited engine module — FrameBudgetManager + RenderPipeline + MLDispatchScheduler + Dashboard renderer + per-pass pipelines). Alternative: CA-Audio (smaller; closes the AudioInputRouter + SilenceDetector + InputLevelMonitor + StreamingMetadata + MetadataPreFetcher surface CA.3 boundary-noted). The App layer is now fully closed.

### Increment CA.5 — App-Layer Capability Audit (engine-adapter slice) ✅ (2026-05-21)

Fifth per-subsystem audit under Phase CA. Produced [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP.md) — 49 files / 7,975 LoC covering the App-layer engine-adapter slice: top-level (14 files including VisualizerEngine + 11 extensions + ContentView + PhospheneApp + MusicKitFetcher), Services/ (30 files), Permissions/ (3 files), Models/ (2 files). The Views/ (47 files) + ViewModels/ (12 files) presentation slice is deferred to CA.6 per the kickoff's recommended sub-scope split (justified by architectural layering — Services + VisualizerEngine adapter are the engine-coupling surface where the four prior audits' findings actually fire; Views + ViewModels is the SwiftUI presentation surface). Headline findings: **48 of 49 files `production-active`; zero `broken-but-claimed`; zero new BUG entries filed**. **BUG-015 wire shape verified clean** — all seven design notes from the BUG-015 Resolved field land in code byte-for-byte (runOrchestratorLiveUpdate(mir:) at +Orchestrator.swift:287, called from +Audio.swift:184 at the end of processAnalysisFrame, cadence gate `analysisFrameCount % orchestratorWireFrameDivisor == 0` with divisor=30 → ~3 Hz, off-plan skip path, liveTrackPlanIndex written in +Capture.swift:131 under orchestratorLock, lastClassifiedMood written in +Audio.swift:432 under orchestratorLock, orchestratorWireLoggedThisTrack reset on track change at +Capture.swift:137, once-per-track diagnostic dual-writing to session.log + os.Logger at +Orchestrator.swift:323-331); the OrchestratorWiringRegressionTests regression test is in place with two `@Test` methods that strip comments before counting (so doc-comment mentions don't satisfy the assertion). **BUG-012-i1 instrumentation intact** across all 8 instrumented files (48 BUG012Probe references total); no edits to instrumented files per CA.5 Hard Rules. **BUG-016 App-layer surface inventoried without proposing a fix**: Lumen Mosaic apply path lives inside `case .rayMarch:` at +Presets.swift:166-178 gated on `desc.name == "Lumen Mosaic"`; slot-8 binding via setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3 is correct per D-LM-buffer-slot-8; LumenPatternEngine init can return nil and the failure logs to os.Logger only (not session.log) — recommend adding sessionRecorder?.log() on the failure branch for the next BUG-016 reproduction. **1 `production-orphan`** at field level — `MultiDisplayToastBridge.coalesceTask` + `MultiDisplayToastBridge.pendingEvents` (`MultiDisplayToastBridge.swift:22-23`) declared but never read or written; the line-21 comment "Coalescing: rapid adds/removes within 0.5s produce one toast" documents an intent the code doesn't implement; cited grep returns only the two declaration sites. Same shape as CA.4-FU-1's `transitionPolicy`. Registered as CA.5-FU-1. **1 `unverified-claim`** — `LiveAdaptationToastBridge.swift:1-14` docstring claims engine-event observation source that has no production-wired consumer (the BUG-015 wire's engine-event downstream consumer logs to os.Logger / session.log via the once-per-track diagnostic but does NOT call `emitAck()`); CA.5-FU-2 surfaces this as a product call (wire engine events through emitAck or rewrite the docstring). **2 large `built-but-undocumented`** — `ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map PhospheneApp/` block listed 15 of 49 engine-adapter files (34 missing); §Module Map Tests/PhospheneApp/ block was absent entirely (60+ test files exist). Same systemic pattern as CA.1 / CA.2 / CA.3 / CA.4. **Plus 1 file-naming drift**: `MusicKitFetcher.swift` contains an `ITunesSearchFetcher` class with explicit "no MusicKit dependency" top-comment — recommend renaming the file per CA.5-FU-3. **D-091 / Failed Approach #55 enforcement verified clean** — cited grep returns only the legitimate `@StateObject SettingsStore()` at `PhospheneApp.swift:25` (the single app-entry instance) plus the regression-test's shadow probe + source-presence assertion; no production re-introduction of the dead pattern. **U.10 / @Suite(.serialized) verified** — the only URLProtocol-stub-using App test (`SpotifyOAuthTokenProviderTests.swift:98 — @Suite("SpotifyOAuthTokenProvider", .serialized)`) carries the annotation. **SwiftLint baseline**: zero warnings in `PhospheneApp/` (the 18 remaining warnings are all in `PhospheneEngine/` — out of CA.5 scope; engine-side SwiftLint cleanup chip is independent). **CA.1-FU-1 status update**: the BUG-015 fix routes `liveBoundary` from `mirPipeline.latestStructuralPrediction` (option (b) from CA.1's framing, NOT option (a) as CA.4 recommended) — the per-frame StructuralAnalyzer chain now has a runtime consumer; CA.1-FU-1 should close as `superseded`. Doc-drift corrections applied to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§Module Map PhospheneApp/ rewritten with all 49 engine-adapter files at one-line behavioural granularity; new PhospheneAppTests/ block under Tests/ listing the load-bearing regression / contract tests including OrchestratorWiringRegressionTests + SettingsStoreEnvironmentRegressionTests + PlaybackChromeIndexBindingTests + DefaultPlaybackActionRouterTests + the U.11 Spotify cluster). **Approach validation**: direct reads + parallel Explore agents both scaled cleanly; Pass 0 BUG-status cross-check found zero kickoff staleness; the cited-grep rule fired once and produced the field-level production-orphan with confidence; the visibility-verification grep continues as cheap insurance for agent reports; the BUG-015 wire-shape verification produced 10 concrete byte-level confirmations. **Recommended next subsystem: CA.6 — App Views + ViewModels** (the deferred half of the App layer; 59 files / 6,889 LoC across `PhospheneApp/Views/` + `PhospheneApp/ViewModels/`; largest unaudited surface in the codebase by file count; home of the U.10 / U.11 flake cluster).

### Increment CA.4 — Orchestrator Capability Audit ✅ (2026-05-20)

Fourth per-subsystem audit under Phase CA. Produced [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ORCHESTRATOR.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ORCHESTRATOR.md) — 14 files / ~2,950 LoC covering scoring + policy core (3 files), planning (3 files), live adaptation (3 files), reactive mode (1 file), signaling (2 files), router + settings (2 files). Headline findings: 12 of 14 files `production-active` at the Orchestrator-module surface; **1 `broken-but-claimed` cluster filed as [BUG-015](QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md#bug-015)** — `VisualizerEngine.applyLiveUpdate(...)` has zero production call sites; `DefaultLiveAdapter.adapt(...)` and `DefaultReactiveOrchestrator.evaluate(...)` are correctly implemented and unit-tested but **never invoked at runtime** because the App-layer audio-callback wire was never added; the entire Phase 4.5 / 4.6 runtime adaptation pipeline is dead in production today; **severity P1** (`pipeline-wiring`); supersedes CA.1-FU-1's framing because there is no runtime consumer of `MIRPipeline.latestStructuralPrediction` until BUG-015 is fixed. **1 `production-orphan`** (`DefaultLiveAdapter.transitionPolicy` field declared and stored but never invoked — both evaluation paths construct `PlannedTransition` values directly; cited grep returns 3 declaration/init hits and 0 invocation hits). **1 `unverified-claim`** (`PresetScorer.swift:86` doc comment cites `(D-030)` for the Weight rationale; D-030 is `SpectralHistoryBuffer as unconditional GPU contract at buffer(5)` — correct citation is D-032; the weight values themselves match D-032 byte-for-byte). **2 large `built-but-undocumented`** (ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map Orchestrator/ listed 5 of 14 source files — 9 missing; §Module Map Tests/Orchestrator/ block was absent entirely — 16 test files exist). **Plus 4 smaller doc-drift findings:** (a) `ARCHITECTURE.md §Orchestrator` "Forthcoming (4.4+)" list (lines 214-219) was obsolete — all four items have shipped at the Orchestrator-module surface; (b) `ARCHITECTURE.md §Orchestrator` line 211 quoted `cutEnergyThreshold > 0.7` — code is `0.85` per D-080 amendment to D-033; (c) `DECISIONS.md` D-032 (line 471) still describes the original `cutEnergyThreshold = 0.7` without the D-080 amendment note; (d) `PresetSignaling.swift:9-10` source-file doc claimed "Arachne does NOT emit yet — wiring is V.7.8" but Arachne has emitted via D-095 / V.7.7C.2 since 2026-05-09 and the orchestrator-side subscription has been wired end-to-end since BUG-011 round 8 on 2026-05-12. **D-120 revert verified clean** — cited grep `grep -rn "concept_tags\|motion_paradigm\|conceptTags\|motionParadigm"` across Swift sources + JSON sidecars returns zero hits; commit `0981ca4f` (2026-05-13) was complete. **CA.1 synthetic-StructuralPrediction re-evaluation resolved**: the synthetic at `SessionPlanner.swift:317-322` is the planning-time construction (`confidence: 1.0`, both timestamps at clock) firing `TransitionPolicy.structuralBoundary` at every track change — it is NOT the source of runtime predictions; runtime predictions would flow through `applyLiveUpdate(...)` → `DefaultLiveAdapter.evaluateBoundaryReschedule(...)` once BUG-015's missing wire lands. **CA.1-FU-1 re-scoped**: ship option (a) (gate the per-frame chain to prep-time only) as a standalone increment now — saves audio-callback CPU with zero behavioural change since no runtime consumer exists pre-BUG-015. Doc-drift corrections applied to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§Orchestrator block rewritten to reflect Phase 4 complete with the BUG-015 caveat for runtime wiring; cutEnergyThreshold value corrected to 0.85; §Module Map Orchestrator/ block extended with all 14 source files and one-line descriptions; §Module Map Tests/Orchestrator/ block added with all 16 test files), `DECISIONS.md` (one-line D-032 amendment note pointing at D-080 rule 5 for the cutEnergyThreshold raise), in-source comments at `PresetScorer.swift:86` (D-030 → D-032) and `PresetSignaling.swift:9-10` (current-state rewrite per D-095 + BUG-011 round 8). **Approach validation:** continue into CA.5 with the methodology refinements above — direct file reads scaled cleanly to the 2,950-LoC Orchestrator subsystem; the cited-grep rule for production-orphan claims fired once with confidence (the dead `transitionPolicy` field is falsifiable in a way independent of auditor interpretation); the CA.1 boundary-touchpoint re-evaluation produced a load-bearing CA.4-specific finding (BUG-015) that the audit format was set up to catch. For CA.5 specifically, declare which App-layer files are read-only in scope so wire-tracing isn't ambiguous. **Recommended next subsystem: App layer** (`PhospheneApp/`) — BUG-015 lives there, plus a constellation of boundary-noted findings that an App audit closes cleanly (`PresetScoringContextProvider`, `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter`, `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator`, `LiveAdaptationToastBridge`, `CaptureModeSwitchCoordinator`, the entire ViewModel + View tree). Alternative: defer CA.5 scope until BUG-015's diagnosis lands if it turns up surprises that motivate a different priority.

### Increment CA.3 — Session Capability Audit ✅ (2026-05-20)

Third per-subsystem audit under Phase CA. Produced [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/SESSION.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/SESSION.md) — 22 files / ~3,425 LoC covering lifecycle + state machine (6 files), preparation pipeline (6 files), track/playlist value types (3 files), boundary-resolved-from-CA.1 (`BeatGridAnalyzer` + `GridOnsetCalibrator`), quality gates (`BPMMismatchCheck`), Spotify connectors (`SpotifyTokenProvider` + `SpotifyWebAPIConnector`), and 1 module marker + 1 stub. Headline findings: 21 of 22 files `production-active`; 1 `stub` (`LocalFolderConnector.swift` is gated behind `#if ENABLE_LOCAL_FOLDER_CONNECTOR` — flag never set in any xcconfig or Package.swift; class never compiles in production; intentional v2 scaffold per D-046 / UX_SPEC §4.4); 2 `documented-but-missing` (`ARCHITECTURE.md §Session Preparation` step list at lines 112–124 omitted D-070 preview-URL primary path, Beat This! offline grid, DSP.4 drums-stem grid, BUG-007.8 grid-onset calibration, and Round 26 metadata-driven `beatsPerBar` override; `§Module Map Tests/Session/` referenced phantom `StemCacheTests`); 2 large `built-but-undocumented` gaps (Session/ module-map block listed 9 of 22 source files — 13 missing; Tests/Session/ listed 9 of 14 real test files — 6 missing + 1 phantom); 0 `production-orphan`; 0 `broken-but-claimed`; 0 new BUG entries. **Kickoff-prompt staleness flagged:** BUG-006 was cited as Open/P1 by the kickoff but `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` already showed `Status: Resolved` (BUG-006.2 wiring fix, 2026-05-06, validated by session `2026-05-06T20-11-46Z`); confirming the kickoff against the issue file before starting is now a recommended CA.4 methodology step. **The CA.1/CA.2 boundary-deferred items all resolved here**: `GridOnsetCalibrator` → `production-active`, recommend relocating to `Sources/DSP/` per `CA.3-FU-1` (functionally a DSP capability; both consumers already import DSP — closes CA.1-FU-5's GridOnsetCalibrator half); `BeatGridAnalyzer` → `production-active`, **stays in Session/** (testability-seam pattern co-located with consumer is correct, matches the 5-protocol family in Session); `MoodClassifier.currentState` end-of-prep read at `SessionPreparer+Analysis.swift:295` → `production-active`, intentional EMA-smoothed-state architecture covering the full ~30 s preview (not drift; the runtime `setMood(...)` path is independently preserved). Doc-drift corrections applied to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§Session Preparation rewritten as a 7-step pipeline matching `SessionPreparer+Analysis.analyzePreview(...)`; §Module Map Session/ block extended with 13 missing files; §Module Map Tests/Session/ corrected — phantom `StemCacheTests` removed, 6 real test files added; §Session Recording gained a `WIRING:`-log surface note for BUG-006.1 + DSP.4). **Approach validation:** continue into CA.4 with three methodology refinements — (1) direct file reads scale to ≤ 5k-LoC subsystems and eliminate the CA.2 "agents over-assert publicness" failure mode entirely; agents remain right for larger modules but the visibility-verification grep is mandatory regardless; (2) cross-check kickoff prompts against `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` as a routine second step — the 30-second BUG-006 staleness cross-check would have saved hours of false-positive diagnosis work; (3) the new `boundary-noted` vs `boundary-deferred` distinction had real bite — three boundary-noted findings (Session ↔ App, Session ↔ Orchestrator, Session ↔ DSP/ML/Audio) were assigned without re-auditing those subsystems' internals. **Recommended next subsystem: Orchestrator** — Session ↔ Orchestrator surface touchpoints already surfaced (`TrackProfile` consumption, `SessionPlan` → `PlannedSession` lift, `PlannedSession.canonicalIdentity` consumed during prepared-cache wiring); auditing Orchestrator closes that boundary cleanly before CA-App or CA-Audio.

### Increment CA.2 — ML Capability Audit ✅ (2026-05-20)

Second per-subsystem audit under Phase CA. Produced [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ML.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ML.md) — 16 files / 4,507 LoC covering the Beat This! transformer (5 files, D-077), the StemSeparator + StemModel + StemFFT cluster (8 files, D-009 / D-010), the MoodClassifier (2 files, D-009), and the ML.swift module marker. Headline findings: zero `broken-but-claimed`; zero new BUG entries; four `production-orphan` clusters at the field/method level — (a) `StemFFTEngineProtocol` (only conformer = `StemFFTEngine` itself; no DI consumer), (b) `StemSeparator.stft/.istft` (public wrappers with zero external callers — tests bypass to `fftEngine.forward/inverse`), (c) five `BeatThisModel` model-dimension constants (`numHeads/.headDim/.numBlocks/.ffnDim/.outputClasses`) with zero external consumers, (d) `MoodClassifier.featureCount/.emaAlpha` + three error-type public exposures with no external catchers. Each cited grep in the audit doc per CA.2 §production-orphan rule. Two large `built-but-undocumented` gaps: the entire Beat This! transformer is absent from `ARCHITECTURE.md §ML Inference` (lines 242–247 described only StemSeparator + MoodClassifier); the `ML/` module-map block at lines 440–447 listed 7 of 16 files (9 missing). One `documented-but-missing`: `ARCHITECTURE.md §Mood Classifier Inputs` claimed "Spectral flux normalized via running-max AGC (0.999 decay)" — the production caller (`VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:240-249`) passes `mir.rawSmoothedFlux` (un-AGC-normalized smoothed flux), which is what the classifier was trained against per `MoodClassifier.swift:14-19`'s input-vector docstring; doc was stale, training/runtime aligned. Doc-drift corrections applied to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§ML Inference: added Beat This! transformer narrative + Open-Unmix HQ window-size constants; §Module Map ML/: added 9 missing files with one-line behavioural descriptions; §Mood Classifier Inputs: replaced stale prose with the per-index table including the raw-flux note) and to `KNOWN_ISSUES.md §BUG-012 → Instrumentation installed` (added a pointer to the audit doc's BUG-012 instrumentation map — the centralised reading-aid that previously didn't exist anywhere). **The audit did not edit any of the 8 BUG-012-i1-instrumented files** per CA.2 Hard Rules; the audit's read of every BUG-012-adjacent code path produced no new candidate root cause; one small diagnostic enrichment is suggested for the next instrumentation tranche as `CA.2-FU-2`. **Approach validation:** the format continues to produce real, actionable findings; the new `production-orphan`-requires-cited-grep rule fired four times with bite; the §BUG-012 instrumentation map is the audit's load-bearing per-increment contribution. Recommend continuing into CA.3 with one pre-grep visibility-verification tweak (Explore agents over-asserted `public` on internal types in 3 of 4 CA.2 cases; a 30-second visibility grep catches the over-assertion). Recommended next subsystem: **Session** — CA.1 + CA.2 between them left three boundary-deferred Session placements (`GridOnsetCalibrator`, `BeatGridAnalyzer`, the `MoodClassifier.currentState` read-at-end-of-prep pattern); closing Session is the natural next step before Renderer / Orchestrator / App. **Alternative:** if BUG-012 reproduces in the next week and Step-2 diagnosis lands, the diagnosis may surface a different priority.

### Increment CA.1 — DSP / MIR Capability Audit ✅ (2026-05-20)

First per-subsystem audit under Phase CA. Produced [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/DSP_MIR.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/DSP_MIR.md) — 22 file-level entities (20 in `PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/` plus 2 boundary-deferred files in `Sources/Session/`), each with verdict + cited evidence. Headline findings: zero `broken-but-claimed`; one real `production-orphan` (the per-frame `StructuralAnalyzer` / `NoveltyDetector` / `SelfSimilarityMatrix` chain runs on the audio-callback hot path but `MIRPipeline.latestStructuralPrediction` has only one consumer — `SessionPreparer+Analysis.swift:289` at *preparation time*; the runtime per-frame work has no live reader); one minor field-level `production-orphan` (`MIRPipeline.spectralRolloff` public exposure has zero non-DSP consumers); one `built-but-undocumented` (`MIRPipeline+Recording` writes a separate `~/phosphene_features.csv` parallel to `SessionRecorder`'s per-session `features.csv`); two `boundary-deferred` to Session-subsystem audit (`GridOnsetCalibrator` + `BeatGridAnalyzer`); one `documented-but-missing` already acknowledged in the doc set (`docs/CAPABILITY_GAP_AUDIT.md`). Doc-drift fixes: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) DSP module map missing 6 of 20 files (including `LiveBeatDriftTracker.swift`, the BUG-007.x focal point) — added; MIR-pipeline-components prose missing `LiveBeatDriftTracker` + the `StructuralAnalyzer` cluster — added; Chroma 65 Hz → 500 Hz value mismatch with code — corrected; Session Recording section missing the manual `R`-shortcut path explanation — added. ENGINEERING_PLAN.md `CAPABILITY_GAP_AUDIT.md` pointer at line 446 — corrected to point at the new `CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/` tree. One retroactive `Resolved` entry filed: [BUG-R010 PT.1 PitchTracker ring-buffer fix](QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md). PT.1 (2026-05-19) had shipped without a `BUG-` entry per CLAUDE.md Defect Handling Protocol; BUG-R010 closes that gap retroactively. **Approach validation:** the format produced real, actionable findings without sliding into structure-as-substance — recommend continuing into CA.2. Recommended next subsystem: **ML** (DSP↔ML boundary closes cleanly; Beat This! test surface already partly in `Tests/ML/`; Session deferred to CA.3+ so the `GridOnsetCalibrator`/`BeatGridAnalyzer` placement question can be answered with full context).

### Increment BUG-012-i1 — MPSGraph crash instrumentation ✅ (2026-05-20)

Step 1 of the multi-increment P1 defect protocol for [BUG-012](QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md#bug-012--mpsgraph-exc_bad_access-in-stemfftengine-during-sustained-force-dispatch). Pure-observability — no behaviour change. Added `Logging.bug012`, new `BUG012Probe` namespace (`Sources/Shared/BUG012Probe.swift`) with dispatch-ID generator + in-flight counters with `.notice`-level **ALARM** logs + lifecycle counters for `StemFFTEngine` / `StemSeparator` / `VisualizerEngine`. Site instrumentation at `StemFFTEngine.init/deinit/forward/inverse/runForwardGraph/runInverseGraph`, `StemSeparator.init/deinit/separate`, `MLDispatchScheduler.decide` (every decision, not just `forceDispatch`), `VisualizerEngine.init/deinit`, `VisualizerEngine+Stems.runStemSeparation/performStemSeparation`. New regression test `BUG012ConcurrencyTest` regression-locks `StemFFTEngine.forward` thread safety. Dispatch-path analysis (race-surface findings, surviving hypothesis: teardown race during MainActor scheduler hop, grep targets for the next reproduction) lives in `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` BUG-012 § "2026-05-20 race-surface analysis". Full closeout in `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` `[dev-2026-05-20-c]`.

Verification: engine + app builds clean; `swift test` 1248 tests / 162 suites with 5 pre-existing-only failures (1 documented flake, 2 SessionManager parallel-load timing flakes, 2 AuroraVeil tests failing due to uncommitted AV.2.h.1 carry-over confirmed by stash-isolation); SwiftLint `--strict` 0 violations on touched files; targeted ML test surface (`BUG012ConcurrencyTest` + `StemFFTTests` + `StemSeparator` Swift Testing suite) 15/15 green.

Step 2 (diagnosis from instrumented reproduction) waits on next BUG-012 crash. Step 3 (fix) waits on diagnosis. Probe + test stay until the bug closes.

### Increment BUG-011 CLOSED — Arachne over Tier 2 frame budget resolved against relaxed drops-only criteria ✅ (2026-05-12)

Matt's 2026-05-12 closure decision after the 37,821-frame production re-capture (session `2026-05-12T20-30-28Z`, ~21 min of pinned Arachne on M2 Pro): drops (>32 ms) = 0.02 % passes the 8 % gate by 400× margin; p95 = 15.303 ms remains 1.3 ms above the 14 ms design target and p50 = 13.708 ms remains above the 8 ms target, but the drops result is the user-perceptible metric and the over-budget frames still complete within one refresh window (~16-17 ms). The architecture contract specifies M3+ as Tier 2; M2 Pro is borderline. Accepting "p95 = 15.3 ms on borderline silicon" is consistent with the contract's spirit.

Total perf delta from pre-tuning baseline (2026-05-08 → 2026-05-12): p95 26.607 → 15.303 ms (−11.3 ms, −42 %); drops 1.46 % → 0.02 % (73× reduction). Achieved via the L1+L2+L3 worst-case-spike tuning (2026-05-10) and the L5 cheap-cleanup tranche (2026-05-12 — `spiralChordBirthTimes` retirement, `strandTangent` retirement, dust-mote `fbm4` early-out).

Known limitation going forward: Arachne on M2 Pro trips the `FrameBudgetManager` p95 > 14 ms threshold ~5 % of the time; governor may downshift quality more aggressively than designed when Arachne is active. M3+ should not see this behaviour. If a future preset addition or shader change eats into the M2 Pro headroom and produces drops, L5.1 (WORLD half-rate refresh) is the next escalation — see `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` BUG-011 historical "Escalation options" section. M3+ measurement deferred (not closure-blocking).

**V.7.10 Arachne cert review unblocked.** The cert-review increment had been gated on BUG-011 closure; closure removes the gate. V.7.10 is now eligible to run when Matt schedules it.

Full narrative: `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` `[dev-2026-05-12-g]`; closure rationale + 21-min re-capture data: `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` BUG-011 § "2026-05-12 closure rationale" and § "2026-05-12 production re-capture (post-cheap-cleanup)".

### Increment BUG-011 L5 cheap-cleanup tranche — three dead-code retirements ✅ (2026-05-12)

Three categories of dead per-pixel work retired on top of the 2026-05-10 L1+L2+L3 worst-case-spike tuning: (1) `ArachneBuildState.spiralChordBirthTimes` CPU-side array — tracked per-chord ages for drop-accretion timing, never read in production after dewdrops were removed in `3f6126e0`; (2) `ArachneWebResult.strandTangent` field + tangent-decision logic in `arachneEvalWeb` — Marschner BRDF input demoted in V.7.9, both consumer sites already `(void)tang2D;`-cast it; (3) dust-mote `fbm4` early-out gate `if (beamMax > 0.01)` in `drawWorld()` — masked contribution was already ~0 outside shaft cones.

SOAK kernel benchmark: p50 12.724 → 11.313 ms (−1.4); p95 14.458 → 12.557 ms (−1.9); overruns >14ms 172 → 1 of 1800 (essentially zero). Projected production p95 16.068 → ~14.1 ms; measured production p95 (37,821-frame re-capture) = 15.303 ms — improvement smaller than SOAK projected because the dust-mote early-out lives in WORLD pass (not exercised by the SOAK harness, which renders COMPOSITE only) and because SOAK runs spider-forced-ON every frame which over-represents the strand-tangent retirement's win.

Verification: 43/43 targeted Arachne tests green; Arachne + spider golden hashes unchanged; app build clean; SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files. Full narrative in `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` `[dev-2026-05-12-f]`.

### Increment BUG-011 round 8 — Arachne build speedup + silent-state pause + completion-gated transitions ✅ (2026-05-12)

Behavioural follow-ups to Matt's session `2026-05-11T23-18-42Z` directive. **NOT a perf increment** — the underlying BUG-011 perf entry in `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` stays Open pending Matt's M2 Pro real-music perf capture; this round-8 work addresses user-facing problems separate from the Tier 2 frame budget.

Three commits on `main`, pushed: `ceb35340` (item 4 — 8 % build speedup via `frameDurationSeconds 3.0 → 2.775`, `radialDurationSeconds 1.5 → 1.389`, `spiralChordsPerBeat = 3.24` with `spiralChordAccumulator: Float` carrying fractional residual; median build cycle ~100 s → ~92 s); `0756a9ef` (item 1 — silent-state pause via new `stemEnergySilenceThreshold = 0.02` on `ArachneBuildState`; build no longer advances when source audio is silent / prep / paused); `04855e26` (item 3 — new `PresetDescriptor.waitForCompletionEvent: Bool` flag; `Arachne.json` sets it on, `maxDuration(forSection:)` returns `.infinity` for flagged presets, `applyLiveUpdate` strips mood-overrides for the active segment; the existing `wirePresetCompletionSubscription` path delivers the transition trigger when the build reaches `.stable`). Item 2 (spokes-below-orb investigation) was a diagnostic step, not a code change — every Arachne window in session `T23-18-42Z` was 47-64 s and caught the build mid-radial-phase; round 7's geometry is correct, and item 3 structurally fixes the cause.

Known limitation: section boundaries still hard-stop completion-gated segments (`planOneSegment` `remainingInSection` cap unchanged) — acceptable because typical sections are ≥ 60 s and Arachne's round-8 build cycle is ~92 s. Revisit if Matt observes the symptom on tracks with shorter sections.

Verification: 36 targeted Arachne tests green; engine 1222 tests / 156 suites with 13 failing assertions all tracing to documented pre-existing flakes per CLAUDE.md baseline (`MatIDDispatch.matID==1`, `MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout`, several `SessionManager.*` parallel-load timing tests); 4 new gate-regression tests added (`silentStateHaltsBuildAdvance`, `silentGateBoundaryIsTwoPercent`, `waitForCompletionEventReturnsInfinity`, `waitForCompletionEventDefaultsFalse`, `arachneIsCompletionGated`, `arachneMaxDurationIsInfinity`); 1 stale test retired (`Arachne is capped by naturalCycleSeconds (60 s)` replaced with `Arachne returns .infinity`); app build clean; SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files. Full narrative in `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` `[dev-2026-05-12-c]` and `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` BUG-011 § "2026-05-12 round-8 follow-up".

### Increment 2.5.4 — Session State Machine & Track Change Behavior ✅

`SessionManager` (`@MainActor ObservableObject`, `Session` module) owns the lifecycle. `startSession(source:)` drives `idle → connecting → preparing → ready`. Graceful degradation: connector failure → `ready` with empty plan; partial preparation failure → `ready` with partial plan. `startAdHocSession()` → `playing` directly (reactive mode). `beginPlayback()` advances `ready → playing`. `endSession()` from any state → `ended`.

Key implementation decisions: `SessionState`/`SessionPlan` live in `Session/SessionTypes.swift` (not `Shared`) because `Shared` cannot depend on `Session`. Cache-aware track-change loading already existed in `resetStemPipeline(for:)` from Increment 2.5.3 — no changes required there. `VisualizerEngine` gained a `sessionManager: SessionManager?` property; the app layer wires `cache → stemCache` on state transition to `.ready`.

11 tests.

### Increment 3.5.2 — Murmuration Stem Routing Revision ✅

Replaced the 6-band full-mix frequency workaround with real stem-driven routing via `StemFeatures` at GPU `buffer(3)`.

`Particles.metal` compute kernel gains `constant StemFeatures& stems [[buffer(3)]]`. Routing: **drums** (`drums_beat` decay drives wave front position) → turning wave that sweeps across the flock over ~200ms, not instantaneously; direction alternates per beat epoch; **bass** (`bass_energy`) → macro drift velocity and shape elongation; **other** (`other_energy`) → surface flutter weighted by `distFromCenter` (periphery 1.0×, core 0.25×); **vocals** (`vocals_energy`) → density compression via `densityScale = 1 - vocals * 0.22` applied to `halfLength` and `halfWidth`.

Warmup fallback: `smoothstep(0.02, 0.06, totalStemEnergy)` crossfades from FeatureVector 6-band routing to stem routing. Zero stems → identical behavior to previous implementation.

`ProceduralGeometry.update()` gains `stemFeatures: StemFeatures = .zero` parameter. `Starburst.metal` gains `StemFeatures` param; `vocals_energy` shifts sky gradient ≤10% warmer.

8 new tests in `MurmurationStemRoutingTests.swift`. 288 swift-testing + 91 XCTest = 379 tests total.

### Increment 3.5.4 — Volumetric Lithograph Preset ✅

New ray-march preset: tactile, audio-reactive infinite terrain rendered with a stark linocut/printmaking aesthetic. Uses the existing deferred ray-march pipeline; no engine changes required.

`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/VolumetricLithograph.metal` defines only `sceneSDF` and `sceneMaterial`; the marching loop and lighting pass come from `rayMarchGBufferPreamble`.

- **Geometry:** `fbm3D` heightfield over an infinite XZ plane. The noise's third axis is swept by `s.sceneParamsA.x` (accumulated audio time) so topography continuously morphs rather than scrolls. Vertical amplitude scaled by `clamp(f.bass + f.mid, 0, 2.5)`. SDF return scaled by 0.6 to keep the marcher Lipschitz-safe on steep ridges.
- **Bimodal materials:** Valleys → `albedo=0, roughness=1, metallic=0` (ultra-matte black). Peaks → `albedo=1, roughness∈[0.06, 0.18], metallic=1` (mirror-bright). Pinched smoothstep edges (0.55→0.72) read as printed lines.
- **Beat accent:** Drum onset shifts the smoothstep window down (`lo -= drumsBeat × 0.18`) so the bright peak region *expands* across the topography on transients. The deferred G-buffer has no emissive channel, so coverage expansion is the contrast-pulse story.
- **D-019 stem fallback:** `StemFeatures` is not in scope for `sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial` (preamble forward-declarations omit it — same as KineticSculpture). Uses `f` directly: `max(f.beat_bass, f.beat_mid, f.beat_composite)` for the drum-beat fallback (CLAUDE.md failed-approach #26 — single-band keying misses snare-driven tracks); `f.treble * 1.4` for the "other" stem fallback (closest single-band proxy for the 250 Hz–4 kHz range).
- **Pipeline:** `["ray_march", "post_process"]` — SSGI intentionally skipped to preserve harsh, high-contrast shadows.
- **JSON:** `family: "fluid"`, low-angle directional light from above-side, elevated camera looking down at terrain, far-plane 60u, `stem_affinity` documented (drums→contrast_pulse, bass→terrain_height, other→metallic_sheen).

Verified by the existing `presetLoaderBuiltInPresetsHaveValidPipelines` regression gate, which compiles and renders every built-in preset through the actual G-buffer pipeline. No new test files required — the gate covers the new preset automatically.

### Increment 3.5.4.1 — Volumetric Lithograph v2 ✅

Session recording (`~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-04-16T16-44-51Z/`, 2,633 frames against Love Rehab — Chaim) revealed four problems with v1: beat fallback `max(beat_bass, beat_mid, beat_composite)` was saturated 86% of the time (median 0.62, p90 1.0) so the peak/valley boundary flickered every frame; pure-grayscale palette read as sepia, not psychedelic; `f.treble × 1.4` polish driver was effectively zero (treble mean 0.0006); and `scene_fog: 0.025` produced an unwanted hazy band across the upper third because the camera was looking down past the fogFar = 40u line.

v2 changes:
- **Calmer motion**: terrain amplitude switched to attenuated bands `f.bass_att + 0.4 × f.mid_att`; `VL_DISP_AUDIO_AMP` 3.4 → 1.8; noise time scale 0.15 → 0.06; noise frequency 0.18 → 0.12 (larger features, slower morph).
- **Selective beat**: `pow(f.beat_bass, 1.5) × 0.7` replaces the saturated `max(...)` — only strong kicks register.
- **Beat as palette flare, not coverage shift**: peak/valley smoothstep window stays geometrically stable; transients push peak palette into HDR bloom instead of flickering the boundary.
- **Sharper edges**: smoothstep window tightened (0.55, 0.72) → (0.50, 0.55); added a thin ridge-line seam (0.495 → 0.51) as a third low-metallic stratum that reads as a luminous "cut paper" highlight.
- **Psychedelic palette**: `palette()` from `ShaderUtilities.metal:576` (IQ cosine palette — first preset to use it) drives peak albedo from `noise × 0.45 + audioTime × 0.04 + valence × 0.25`. Cyan-magenta-yellow rotation via `(0, 0.33, 0.67)` phase shift. Albedo IS F0 for metals (RayMarch.metal:239) so saturated colors produce saturated reflections.
- **Stem-proxy correctness**: `sqrt(f.mid) × 1.6` replaces `f.treble × 1.4` for the polish driver — `f.mid` (250 Hz–4 kHz) overlaps the actual "other" stem range, and `sqrt` boost handles AGC-compressed real-music values.
- **Atmosphere**: `scene_fog` 0.025 → 0; `scene_far_plane` 60 → 80; `scene_ambient` 0.04 → 0.06; camera lowered to `[0, 6.5, -8.5] → [0, 0, 7]` so fewer sky pixels, more terrain.

Same regression gate covers compilation/render. No new tests.

### Increment 3.5.4.2 — Volumetric Lithograph v3 + shared fog-fallback bug fix ✅

Two issues surfaced during v2 visual review on Love Rehab:

**Bug 1 (shared infra):** `PresetDescriptor+SceneUniforms.makeSceneUniforms()` line 85 had a broken `scene_fog == 0` fallback: it reused `uniforms.sceneParamsB.y` which starts at SIMD4 default 0. The shader formula `fogFactor = clamp((t - 0) / max(0 - 0, 0.001), 0, 1)` then saturates to 1.0 for any terrain hit — so "no fog" actually produced **maximum fog everywhere**. Fixed: fallback now returns `1_000_000` (effectively infinite fogFar), matching the intuitive "0 means no fog" semantic. No test impact — no existing preset set `scene_fog: 0`.

**Rebalance (v3):** v2 over-corrected. `pow(f.beat_bass, 1.5) × 0.7` with `× 0.6` palette brightness multiplier produced visually inert beat response on energetic music — ACES squashed the boost back into SDR before post-process bloom could amplify it. v3 changes:
- Drum-beat fallback: `pow(f.beat_bass, 1.2) × 1.5` (saturates at beat_bass ≈ 0.7 rather than never).
- Palette flare: × 1.5 (was × 0.6) — peaks push to 2.5× albedo on strong kicks, bloom-visible.
- Ridge seam strobe: `× (1.4 + beat × 2.0)` — the cut-line itself strobes at up to 3.4× brightness.
- Coverage expansion on beat: 0.03 smoothstep shift (v1 had 0.18 which flickered every frame; v2 had 0 which was dead).
- Transient terrain kick in `sceneSDF`: `f.beat_bass × 0.35` added to attenuated baseline amp — landscape breathes on kicks without replacing the slow-flowing base.

Same regression gate covers both changes.

### Increment 3.5.4.3 — v3.1 palette tuning ✅

Data analysis of the v2 diagnostic session (`2026-04-16T17-33-10Z`, 3,749 active frames on Love Rehab) surfaced three palette-level issues that the v3 fix alone did not address:

1. **Palette rotation too slow**: `accumulatedAudioTime × 0.04` only advanced 0.20 over 64 seconds of playback (20% of one color cycle). All sampled frames read as the same teal because the palette barely rotated. Bumped to × 0.15 — one full cyan→magenta→yellow cycle every ~7 seconds of active audio.
2. **Spatial hue spread too narrow**: peak pixels exist where noise n ∈ [0.55, 1.0], so `n × 0.45` capped the peak contribution at 0.20 — all peaks in a single frame looked the same hue. Bumped to × 0.9 — doubles per-peak variation so different ridges show different colors.
3. **Valley brightness too low**: `palette(phase + 0.5) × 0.08` was drowned out by the valence-tinted IBL ambient; valleys read as uniform dark brown rather than complementary palette color. Bumped × 0.08 → × 0.15.

Same regression gate. Landed alongside v3 fixes.

### Increment 3.5.4.4 — v3.2 "pulse-rate too fast" + sky tint ✅

Matt's visual review of v3.1 (session `2026-04-16T18-24-43Z` on Love Rehab):
1. **"Pulsing faster than the beat"** — v3.1 had ~35% of the terrain classified as peaks (smoothstep lo=0.50 sat right at the fbm mean), noise shimmer at `audioTime × 0.06` drifting high-octave detail fast, and palette rotation at 0.15 — all continuous, non-beat-locked motion. Beat-aligned flares (flare, strobe, kick) existed but drowned in the background activity.
2. **"Neutral gray backdrop"** — v3's fog fix exposed the raw `rm_skyColor` sky, which skipped the `scene.lightColor` multiplier that fog already used. On a preset with a warm `[1, 0.94, 0.84]` light, the sky stayed blue-gray.

Fixes:
- Peak coverage: smoothstep window `(0.50, 0.55) → (0.56, 0.60)` — peaks now ~15% of scene (linocut "highlights on paper"), ridge band `(0.495, 0.51) → (0.555, 0.565)`.
- Noise time scale `0.06 → 0.015` (4× slower high-octave drift).
- Palette rotation `0.15 → 0.08` (~1 cycle per preset duration).
- **Shared fix** (RayMarch.metal:208): miss/sky pixels now multiplied by `scene.lightColor.rgb`, matching the fog-colour treatment. Benefits every ray-march preset with a non-white light colour (Glass Brutalist, Kinetic Sculpture, VL).

Same regression gate.

### Increment 3.5.4.5 — v3.3: correct beat driver (f.bass, not f.beat_bass) ✅

Matt flagged that v3.2 pulses still didn't sync with the driving kick on Love Rehab. Session `2026-04-16T18-44-45Z` diagnostic:

**Rising-edge analysis of `f.beat_bass` in a 4-second window** revealed intervals of **410/403/421/397/435/418/431/399/488 ms** → mean **420ms = 143 BPM**. Love Rehab is 125 BPM (480ms intervals). **Local-maxima analysis of the continuous `f.bass`** revealed intervals of **499/526/495/504/531/452/549 ms** → mean **508ms = 118 BPM**, within normal variation of the real 125 BPM kick.

**Root cause**: `f.beat_bass` has a 400ms cooldown (CLAUDE.md "Onset Detection"). On tracks with dense off-kick bass content (syncopated basslines, double-time sub-bass), the cooldown causes beat_bass to phase-lock to the 400ms window itself rather than the real kick — producing a consistent phantom tempo that's faster than the music. This is a music-dependent failure mode of the onset detector, not a VL bug, but it affects any preset that reads `f.beat_bass` directly.

**Fix (VL-local)**: Switched all beat-aligned drivers from `f.beat_bass` to `smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass)`. `f.bass` is the continuous 3-band bass energy with no cooldown gating — its peaks naturally align with real kicks. Smoothstep shape gives clean 0→1 transitions matching the kick rhythm. Also removed the `0.4 × f.mid_att` contribution from `slowAmp` — mid band has ~4.6 onsets/sec (hi-hat/clap) on Love Rehab, which was leaking a non-kick rhythm into the terrain amplitude.

**Out of scope for this increment**: `f.beat_bass` cooldown-phase-lock affects other presets (Kinetic Sculpture, Glass Brutalist via shared Swift path, Ferrofluid Ocean). Worth following up on at the engine level — either shorten cooldown, or prefer a stem-separated kick onset (when `stems.drumsBeat` is fixed — session data also showed it firing only 2 times in 90s, which is a separate engine bug).

Same regression gate.

### Increment 3.5.4.6 — v3.4: use f.bass_att (pre-smoothed), not f.bass threshold ✅

Matt flagged v3.3 beat sync was still wrong AND motion was too sharp. Session `2026-04-16T18-56-59Z` diagnostic revealed:

**v3.3's `smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass)` fires at 65 BPM on a 125 BPM track** — half tempo. Root cause: Love Rehab's f.bass peaks in this session range 0.20–0.31. Kicks at the low end (0.20–0.23) never cleanly cross the 0.22 threshold, so only LOUDER kicks trigger a rise. Result: phantom half-tempo rhythm.

**Smoothstep with narrow range (0.22, 0.32) produces near-binary 0→1 output.** That's the "sharp, less smooth" character — visible motion was a 2-frame transition rather than a gradual envelope.

Cross-driver analysis tested five alternatives against the 125 BPM target:
- `smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass)` — 65 BPM (current v3.3, half-tempo)
- `smoothstep(0.13, 0.32, f.subBass)` — 111 BPM (better)
- `smoothstep(0.10, 0.25, f.bass_att)` — 121 BPM ✓
- `smoothstep(0.08, 0.22, f.bass_att)` — **127 BPM** ✓✓
- `f.bass_att × 4 clamped` — 126 BPM ✓

**Fix (v3.4)**: drive everything from `f.bass_att` (the 0.95-smoothed bass band). It catches every kick via smoothing (no threshold-miss), is inherently smooth (no sharpening artefacts), and tracks at 127 BPM on a 125 BPM track. Single driver replaces the two-stage design:
- `sceneSDF`: `audioAmp = clamp(f.bass_att × 3.5, 0, 2.0)` (was slow `f.bass_att` + sharp `smoothstep(f.bass) × 0.40`)
- `sceneMaterial`: `drumsBeatFB = smoothstep(0.06, 0.25, f.bass_att)` (was `smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass)`)

Same regression gate.

### Increment 3.5.4.7 — v4: melody-primary drivers + forward dolly ✅

Matt tested v3.4 on Tea Lights (Lower Dens — acoustic/electric guitar, no kick drum). Result: total failure. v3's bass-only drivers had nothing to track. Also asked about forward camera motion.

Session `2026-04-16T20-09-44Z` data showed:
- `f.mid_att × 15` tracks melodic phrasing at 72 BPM on Tea Lights (matches song tempo).
- `f.spectral_flux` fires at ~190 BPM on *any* timbral attack — kicks, guitar strums, vocal onsets, piano chord changes.
- Stem data (`stems.vocalsEnergy` 0.30 mean, `stems.otherEnergy` 0.26 mean) is the true melody carrier but isn't in `sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial` preamble scope.

Changes:
- `sceneSDF audioAmp`: melody-primary blend — `0.75 × clamp(f.mid_att × 15, 0, 1.5) + 0.35 × clamp(f.bass_att × 1.2, 0, 1)`.
- `sceneMaterial accentFB`: `smoothstep(0.35, 0.70, f.spectral_flux)` replaces bass-keyed driver. Flare multipliers reduced (× 1.5 → × 0.8 peak, × 2.0 → × 1.0 ridge, 0.03 → 0.02 coverage shift) for softer ambient match.
- Palette phase adds `f.mid_att × 3.0` — colour rotates with melodic phrasing.
- Amplitude reduced 1.8 → 1.4 to pair with dolly.
- Camera lifted Y 6.5 → 7.2, FOV narrowed 60 → 55, **forward dolly at 1.8 u/s** via new switch in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` (replaces ternary; pattern extensible for future presets).

### Increment 3.5.4.8 — SessionRecorder writer relock + StemFeatures in preamble ✅

Two follow-ups from v4, both explicitly requested by Matt. Bundled because both surfaced in the same diagnostic loop and both are prerequisites for clean next-iteration work.

**A. SessionRecorder writer relock.** Session `2026-04-16T20-09-44Z` lost 1,861 frames (~31s) because the writer locked to transient Retina-native drawable dimensions (1802×1202) observed for the first 30 frames, then rejected every subsequent frame at the steady-state logical-point size (901×601). The old guard was correct in spirit (avoid locking to transient launch-time dimensions) but couldn't recover when the "stable" size itself was the transient.

Fix: if the drawable arrives consistently at a different size for `writerRelockThreshold` (90) frames after initial lock, tear down the current writer, remove the partial `video.mp4`, and recreate at the new size. Conservative enough that it doesn't trigger on normal mid-session resizes (which should still be rare). Test `test_recordFrame_relocksWhenDrawableStabilisesAtDifferentSize` simulates the exact Tea Lights scenario.

**B. `StemFeatures` in `sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial` preamble.** Opens per-preset stem routing (Milkdrop-style) to the entire ray-march preset pipeline. The preamble forward-declarations, G-buffer fragment call sites, and all 4 existing presets gain a `constant StemFeatures& stems` parameter:

- `TestSphere`, `GlassBrutalist`, `KineticSculpture`: parameter added for signature conformance, unused internally — existing visual behaviour preserved (GB still ships its Option-A design, KS still uses its validated FeatureVector routing as commented in the header).
- `VolumetricLithograph`: upgraded to true stem reads with D-019 warmup fallback. Terrain amp melody now reads `stems.other_energy + stems.vocals_energy` (with `f.mid_att × 15` fallback); accent now reads `stems.drums_beat` (with `f.spectral_flux` fallback); peak polish reads `stems.other_energy` (with `sqrt(f.mid) × 1.6` fallback). All blended via `smoothstep(0.02, 0.06, totalStemEnergy)` so the first few seconds before stem separation completes fall back gracefully to FeatureVector routing.
- Test fixtures in `RayMarchPipelineTests.swift` and `SSGITests.swift` updated to match the new signature — this actually repairs `RayMarchPipelineTests` which was failing before v4 with undefined-symbol errors because the fixture was stale for the earlier sceneMaterial signature change.

Verified: `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetLoaderTests` 12/12 passing (including the full-pipeline render gate), `RayMarchPipelineTests` 10/10 passing, `SSGITests` 7/7 passing, `SessionRecorderTests` 7/7 passing (including the new relock test).

### Increment 3.5.4.9 — Per-frame stem analysis (engine-level) ✅

Session `2026-04-16T20-56-46Z` diagnostic on Tea Lights revealed the architectural root cause of repeated "terrain stops moving but colours keep changing" failures: **`StemFeatures` values in GPU buffer(3) update only once per 5-second stem separation cycle**. The uploaded `stems.csv` showed only 25 unique `drumsBeat` values across 8,987 rows (0.3% uniqueness); identical vocals/drums/bass/other energies held for 300+ consecutive frames then stepped to a new set. Any preset reading stems directly got a piecewise-constant driver with 5-second freeze-then-jump dynamics — no matter how careful the shader design.

**Root cause** (`VisualizerEngine+Stems.runStemSeparation`): after each 5s `StemSeparator.separate()` call, the engine ran a 600-frame AGC warmup loop on `stemQueue` and uploaded ONLY the final frame's features via `pipeline.setStemFeatures(features)`. The intermediate frames — which DO produce continuously-varying output when fed sliding windows of the same waveform — were discarded.

**Fix** (preserves 5s separation cadence, adds per-frame analysis):
- `runStemSeparation` now stores the separated waveforms + wall-clock timestamp under a new `stemsStateLock`, then returns. No analyzer calls or GPU uploads from `stemQueue` any more.
- `processAnalysisFrame` (called on `analysisQueue` at audio-callback rate, ~94 Hz) reads the latest stored waveforms under lock, slides a 1024-sample window through them at real-time rate (starting 5s into the 10s chunk, advancing by `elapsed × 44100` samples), runs `StemAnalyzer.analyze` on the window, and uploads the result via `pipeline.setStemFeatures`. AGC warms up naturally over the first ~60 frames of each new chunk.
- `resetStemPipeline` clears the stored waveforms on track change so stems don't leak across tracks.

**Cadence improvement**: 1 stem upload every 5000 ms → 1 upload every ~10 ms. **500× more frequent**.

**Latency**: stem features lag real audio by ~5-10s (separator works on past audio and we scan the last 5s of each chunk). Acceptable because musical sections persist longer than that. A future enhancement could shorten the chunk or overlap separations.

**Side benefit**: `stems.csv` in future SessionRecorder dumps now shows continuously-varying per-frame values instead of 5s-flat blocks, making preset diagnostics far cleaner.

**Tests**: new `StemAnalyzerTests.swift` pins the sliding-window contract so future refactors can't silently regress:
- `stemAnalyzer_slidingWindows_produceVaryingFeatures` — feeds sliding 1024-sample windows through a ramped waveform, asserts non-zero spread + smooth per-frame deltas.
- `stemAnalyzer_sameWindow_producesStableFeatures` — convergence on repeated identical input.
- `stemAnalyzer_zeroLengthWindow_returnsZeroFeatures` — safety under empty input.

Verified: 3/3 new tests pass; full suite 308/314 with only pre-existing environmental failures (Apple Music not running × 4, perf flake, network timeout).

### Increment 3.5.5 — Arachne Preset (bioluminescent spider webs) ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21

Bioluminescent spider web visualizer using the M3+ mesh shader pipeline with vertex fallback for M1/M2. Key decisions and implementation:

- **`ArachneState.swift`** — 12-web pool with beat-measured stage lifecycle (anchorPulse → radial → spiral → stable → evicting). Drum-driven spawn accumulator (`drumsOnsetRate × dt × stemMix`). LCG PRNG seeded per-web for deterministic layout. GPU `webBuffer` (MTLBuffer, 12 × 64 bytes) flushed after every tick. 2 pre-seeded stable webs satisfy D-037 inv.1 and inv.4 from frame zero.
- **`Arachne.metal`** — Object shader dispatches 12 mesh threadgroups (one per web slot). 64-thread mesh shader: thread 0 = hub cap, threads 1–8 = anchor dots, threads 9–16 = radial spokes, threads 17–56 = spiral segments. Inactive threads write off-screen geometry. Dead webs: `set_primitive_count(0)`. Fragment shader: D-019 stemMix warmup, bass-driven strand quiver, MV-3b beat anticipation.
- **`PresetCategory.organic`** added — keeps Arachne separate from abstract/geometric families in Orchestrator family-repeat scoring. D-038 in DECISIONS.md.
- **`ArachneStateTests.swift`** — 8 unit tests covering all 8 pool-management invariants from D-037.

**Visual tuning (post-session 2026-04-21T13-26-38Z):** First playback revealed three issues: (1) hub throb used `sin(time * 9)` — continuous free-running oscillation with no music connection; (2) strand quiver scrolled at fixed `time * 4.8` rate, never syncing to beats; (3) bioluminescent effect weak — sat=0.72 and linear glow falloff. Fixes: (1) hub throb during anchorPulse replaced with `anticipation * 0.9` (beat_phase01-driven only); (2) quiver wave phase-locked to beat via `sin(dist*12 - beat_phase01*2π)` so one wave propagates per beat; (3) sat raised to 0.92, glow changed to `exp2(-dist*3)` exponential falloff with darker base (0.20) and brighter hub (0.85). **Rule: never use free-running `sin(time)` for motion in organic presets — all oscillation should be beat-anchored or at minimum audio-amplitude-gated.**

**Verification:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` → 427 tests pass; `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp` → BUILD SUCCEEDED; SwiftLint → 0 violations in active sources.

### Increment 3.5.6 — Gossamer Preset (bioluminescent sonic resonator) ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21

Bioluminescent hero-web as a musical resonator. A single SDF-drawn static web (12 radials + Archimedean capture spiral) acts as the "instrument body"; up to 32 vocal-pitch-keyed propagating color waves travel outward from the hub along all radials simultaneously, leaving decaying echoes via mv_warp temporal feedback.

- **`GossamerState.swift`** — 32-wave pool. Each `Wave` has birthTime, hue (baked from YIN pitch), saturation (baked from other-stem density), amplitude (baked from vocals_energy_dev). Emission gates on `vocalsPitchConfidence > 0.35 OR |vocalsEnergyDev| > 0.05`; below threshold, accumulator integrates but no wave is emitted. Ambient drift floor guarantees waveCount ≥ 2 at silence. Retirement when `age > maxWaveLifetime = 6s`. GPU buffer (528 bytes): GossamerGPU header + 32 WaveGPU (16 bytes each). Bound at `fragment buffer(6)` via `pipeline.setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer` / `directPresetFragmentBuffer` in RenderPipeline.
- **`Gossamer.metal`** — SDF scene (radial spokes + Archimedean spiral strand) drawn at each fragment; color waves sampled as a ring-pass at `|dist - waveRadius| < waveWidth`. mv_warp pass accumulates decaying echoes (decay=0.955). D-026 deviation-first; D-019 warmup; D-037 acceptance satisfied via background gradient + seeded waves.
- **`GossamerStateTests.swift`** — 8 unit tests: initial pool, emission rate, confidence gate, FV fallback, retirement, silence stability, pool eviction, determinism.

**Verification:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` → 435 tests pass; `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp` → BUILD SUCCEEDED.

### Increment 3.5.7 — Stalker Preset — **Retired** ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21 | **Retired:** 2026-04-21

Stalker was the original third entry in the Arachnid Trilogy: a black silhouette spider crossing a background web with a realistic alternating-tetrapod gait, triggered to a listening pose by sustained low-attack-ratio bass. After seeing all three trilogy presets in the session, the design was revised: the static-web-with-traversing-spider pattern created dead time (nothing interesting while the spider is offscreen) and the 2D mesh silhouette lacked the visual fidelity the preset deserved. The gait solver, sustained-bass discriminator, and GPU buffer architecture were retained as engineering foundations; the spider will be reborn as a 3D ray-march SDF easter egg triggered inside Arachne (see Increment 3.5.8).

**Removed files:** `Stalker/StalkerGait.swift`, `Stalker/StalkerState.swift`, `Stalker/StalkerState+GPU.swift`, `Shaders/Stalker.metal`, `Shaders/Stalker.json`, `StalkerGaitTests.swift`, `StalkerStateTests.swift`. All `stalkerState` references removed from `VisualizerEngine.swift` and `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`.

**Post-retirement:** 440 tests pass; BUILD SUCCEEDED; 0 SwiftLint violations.

### Increment 3.5.8 — Arachne + Gossamer visual rework ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21

Post-session visual feedback on all three Arachnid Trilogy presets surfaced actionable changes to Arachne and Gossamer. No logic regressions; 440 tests pass before and after.

**Arachne changes:**
- **Stage pacing slowed 3×**: `radialDuration` → `Float(anchorCount) × 2.0` beats (10–16 beats), `spiralDuration` → `max(20.0, revolutions × 2.5)` (≥20 beats). At 120 BPM a full build now takes ≥18s. `evictingDuration` extended to 4 beats.
- **Per-web golden-ratio hue**: `birthHue = fract(Float(slot) × 0.618 + centroidJitter)`. 12 web slots distribute across the hue wheel with no repetition (Fibonacci dispersion).
- **Anchor dots removed**: threads 1–8 in the mesh shader always write offscreen. Anchors remain as spoke endpoints.
- **2-layer bioluminescent glow**: fragment replaced smooth-step cross-section profile with `exp(-d²×22)` core + `exp(-d²×3.8)` halo. Hub-fade term `exp(-dist²×3.5)` brightens strand bases. Hub cap uses circular gaussian instead of hard smoothstep.
- **Saturation locked high**: `birthSat = 0.88 + lcg * 0.10` (vs centroid-derived). Seeded webs use slot-0/1 golden-ratio hues at sat=0.92.

**Gossamer changes:**
- **Gaussian wave rings**: `exp(-(dr²) / (sigma²))` with sigma=0.011 UV. Eliminates hard-edge "block" artifacts from the previous `smoothstep(thickness, 0.0, dr)`.
- **Web breathing**: radials brighten with `max(0, bassRel) × 0.65`, spiral with `max(0, mid_att_rel) × 0.50`. Blend weight from per-pixel `radCov / (radCov + spirCov)`.
- **2-layer strand halos**: Gaussian halo terms `exp(-rDist²/0.0055²)` and `exp(-sDist²/0.0045²)` add visible luminous aura around each strand.
- **Complementary color pairs**: each wave also contributes `hsv2rgb(hue + 0.5, sat × 0.45, amp × 0.30)` for iridescent shimmer at wave edges.
- **Interference blooms**: `saturate(totalRingWeight - 1.0) × 0.45 × strandCov` adds warm-white burst where ≥2 waves overlap.
- **Reduced mv_warp decay**: `0.955 → 0.90` (shorter trails, sharper visual impact per wave). JSON sidecar updated.
- **Saturation floor raised**: `emitWave` saturation floor `0.5 → 0.85`; drift waves `0.60 → 0.90`; seeded waves `0.70/0.65 → 0.92/0.90`.

### Increment 3.5.9 — Spider easter egg in Arachne ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21

**Scope:** Add a 3D ray-march SDF spider that appears as a rare easter egg inside the Arachne mesh-shader preset. Frequency target: ~1-in-10 songs. Trigger: sustained sub-bass (`subBass > 0.65`, `bassAttackRatio < 0.55`, held ≥ 0.75 s) + session-level cooldown (≥5 min between appearances). Calibration track: James Blake "Limit to Your Love" — prominent sub-bass drop after the chorus.

**Design:**
- Spider materialises on the web — positioned at the hub, limbs following radials in rest pose.
- Fragment: ray-march SDF through the Arachne fragment shader (invoked when the spider is active via `spiderBlend > 0`). The spider SDF runs as an overlay pass in the mesh shader fragment.
- Body: smooth-union ellipsoids — cephalothorax (major 0.06, minor 0.045), abdomen (major 0.08, minor 0.055), pedipalps (2 small spheres).
- Legs: 8 × 3-joint tapered capsule chain. Hip joint at radial anchor positions; intermediate joints at ~0.55× full length; tip near spiral perimeter. Radius tapers 0.008 (hip) → 0.002 (tip).
- Material: dark chitinous exoskeleton. Base albedo 0.015 (near-black). Clearcoat 0.85, roughness 0.08 for dramatic specular. Thin-film iridescence: `sin(normalDot × 12) × 0.15` shifts surface hue in cyan/violet band.
- Lighting: lit primarily by the web's bioluminescent emission (nearest radials and spiral segments as area lights approximated by nearest `radCov`/`spirCov` values already computed in the fragment).
- Animation: gait solver computed in `ArachneState.tick()` — same alternating-tetrapod math as the original GaitSolver but embedded in `ArachneState` (no separate file). State: `spiderBlend` (0 = absent, 1 = fully materialized), `spiderPos` (hub-relative UV), `spiderHeading`, `gaitPhase`.
- GPU: extend `WebGPU` to include 1 extra `float4 × 12` block (spider body + 8 leg tip positions), OR add a separate `ArachneSpiderGPU` buffer at `object/mesh buffer(2)`. The latter is cleaner; the fragment will need to receive it via a separate binding.
- Fade: spider materialises over ~2 s via `spiderBlend` easing. Dematerialises after sustained-bass condition ends (same asymmetric decay as original StalkerState accumulator).

**Files to touch:** `ArachneState.swift` (gait solver + spider state + sub-bass trigger), `Arachne.metal` (spider SDF + fragment overlay), `ArachneStateTests.swift` (4 new tests: trigger fires on sustained sub-bass, does NOT fire on kick, spider dematerialises, cooldown gate).

### Increment 3.5.10 — Arachne ray march remaster ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-22

**Scope:** Replace Arachne's mesh-shader preset with a full 3D SDF ray-marched scene. The mesh-shader implementation used free-running `sin(time)` oscillators that made motion feel mechanical and disconnected from audio (failed approach #33, session 2026-04-21T13-26-38Z). The ray-march approach gives correct 3D perspective, unique per-web tilt, beat-phase-locked vibration, and proper temporal accumulation via mv_warp.

**Architecture changes:**
- `Arachne.json`: passes changed from `["mesh_shader"]` to `["mv_warp"]`. Preset is now a direct fragment shader + mv_warp, not a mesh shader.
- `Arachne.metal`: complete rewrite as 3D SDF ray march. 64-step march; perspective camera 60° FOV at z=−1.8 (close enough for dramatic web scale). Each web is a tilted disc of SDF tubes; tilt derived from `rng_seed` field (±14% X, ±10% Y before normalisation). Pool webs at `hub_xy × {0.9, 0.8}` spread, depth mapped z∈[−0.4, 1.4]. Permanent anchor web at `(0, 0, 0.2)` (D-037). Spider SDF from Increment 3.5.9 always placed at anchor position; fixes Z-depth mismatch of the old mesh-shader approach. `sdWebElement` draws hub cap + progressive radials (alternating-pair order, ±22% angular jitter per spoke) + Archimedean spiral with corrected SDF (`min(fract, 1−fract)` — `abs(fract−0.5)` was inverted, rendering filled sectors instead of strands). Tube radius 0.012 world units ≈ 11 px at 1080p. Soft bioluminescent glow `exp2(−minWebDist × 14)` for miss rays ensures D-037 formComplexity at any resolution. mv_warp decay=0.92.
- `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`: Arachne setup moved from `.meshShader` case to `.mvWarp` case. Buffer(6) = web pool, buffer(7) = spider GPU.
- `RenderPipeline.swift` + `RenderPipeline+PresetSwitching.swift` + `RenderPipeline+MVWarp.swift`: added `directPresetFragmentBuffer2` (buffer(7)) infrastructure.
- `PresetAcceptanceTests.swift`: buffer(7) bound (zeroed) so spider `blend=0` during tests.
- `PresetRegressionTests.swift`: Arachne golden hash regenerated.

444 tests pass; 0 SwiftLint violations.

### Increment 3.5.11 — Gossamer SDF correction + v3 acceptance gate ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-22

**Problem 1 — Inverted SDF in spiral and hub-ring distance functions.** `gossamerSpiralDist` and `gossamerHubDist` both used `abs(fract(x) − 0.5)` as their fold formula. This gives 0 in the GAPS between threads and 0.5 ON the threads — the opposite of what a distance function requires. The result: the entire capture zone rendered as a uniformly lit filled disc (the SDF gave zero distance everywhere off-thread, fully covering everything via the coverage and halo terms). Fixed to `min(fract(x), 1 − fract(x))` which correctly gives 0 ON the thread.

**Problem 2 — D-037 acceptance invariant 3 failure (beat response bounded).** The inverted SDF caused silence and steady-energy renders to look identical (both uniformly lit at `0.55 × baseColor`). `meanSquaredDiff(silence, steady) = 0` while `meanSquaredDiff(steady, beat-heavy) = 151` — the beat flash was seen as an overreaction relative to zero continuous motion. Fixed in two parts: (a) `brightness = 0.12 + f.bass × 0.76 + bassRel × 0.12` — absolute `f.bass` creates a music-presence glow so silence (f.bass=0) is dim and steady music (f.bass≈0.5) is lit; (b) `beatFlash` reduced from 0.65 to 0.30 to keep beat accent proportional to the continuous baseline.

**Geometry changes (v3):** 17 explicitly-defined irregular spoke angles replacing formula-derived equal spacing. Off-center hub at (0.465, 0.32). Elliptical stretch removed. `kWebRadius` expanded 0.42→0.44. See D-042.

444 tests pass; 0 SwiftLint violations. Golden hashes regenerated for Gossamer and Arachne.

### Increment MV-0 — Drop v4.2 stash, re-land sky-tint conditional ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-16, commit `91f698d5`

Dropped the v4.2 git stash. Re-applied the `RayMarch.metal:208` sky-tint conditional: miss/sky pixels now multiply by `scene.lightColor.rgb` only when `sceneParamsB.y > 1e5` (fog-disabled sentinel). This restores cool-sky/warm-light contrast on Glass Brutalist and Kinetic Sculpture while preserving VolumetricLithograph's warm sky tint when `scene_fog: 0`.

All preset-pipeline regression tests passing.

### Increment MV-1 — Milkdrop-correct audio primitives ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-16, commit `a05fd753`

`FeatureVector` expanded 32→48 floats (128→192 bytes). Nine new deviation fields derived each frame in `MIRPipeline.buildFeatureVector()`:
- `bassRel/Dev`, `midRel/Dev`, `trebRel/Dev` — centered deviation from AGC midpoint.
- `bassAttRel`, `midAttRel`, `trebAttRel` — smoothed deviation for continuous motion drivers.

`StemFeatures` expanded 16→32 floats (64→128 bytes). Eight new stem deviation fields derived in `StemAnalyzer.analyze()` via per-stem EMA (decay 0.995):
- `{vocals,drums,bass,other}EnergyRel/Dev`.

Metal preamble structs in `PresetLoader+Preamble.swift` updated to match. `VolumetricLithograph.metal` converted to deviation-based drivers as reference implementation. All other presets grandfathered. `RelDevTests.swift` (4 contract tests) gates the invariants. CLAUDE.md documents the authoring convention.

**CHECKPOINT outcome:** deviation primitives alone did not converge VL on "feels musical" — confirmed the architectural gap (missing per-vertex feedback warp) is the critical path. MV-2 proceeded as planned.

### Increment MV-2 — Per-vertex feedback warp mesh ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-17, commit `c8cd558f`

New `mv_warp` render pass implementing Milkdrop-style 32×24 per-vertex feedback warp. Any preset opts in via `"mv_warp"` in its `passes` JSON array.

**Architecture:** Three passes per frame:
1. **Warp pass** — 32×24 vertex grid (4278 vertices). Each vertex calls preset-authored `mvWarpPerFrame()` + `mvWarpPerVertex()`. Fragment samples `warpTexture` (previous frame) at displaced UV × `pf.decay` → `composeTexture`.
2. **Compose pass** — fullscreen quad. Alpha-blends `sceneTexture` (current scene) onto `composeTexture` with `alpha = (1 - decay)`.
3. **Blit pass** — `composeTexture` → drawable. Swap warp ↔ compose for next frame.

**Key implementation details:**
- `MVWarpPipelineBundle` (public struct) holds 3 `MTLRenderPipelineState` + `pixelFormat`. Created in `applyPreset` from `PresetLoader`-compiled states.
- `MVWarpState` marked `@unchecked Sendable` because `MTLTexture` protocol is not `Sendable` in Swift 6.0.
- `SceneUniforms` is forward-declared in `mvWarpPreamble` behind `#ifndef SCENE_UNIFORMS_DEFINED` so direct (non-ray-march) presets compile without the ray-march preamble. Ray-march preamble wraps its own definition in the same guard to prevent redefinition.
- Ray-march + mv_warp handoff: `.rayMarch` renders to offscreen `warpState.sceneTexture` when `.mvWarp` is also in `activePasses`; `.mvWarp` handles drawable presentation.
- Initial texture allocation uses 1920×1080; `reallocateMVWarpTextures` fires from `drawableSizeWillChange` with actual drawable size before first frame.

**Presets converted:**
- `VolumetricLithograph` — `passes: ["ray_march", "post_process", "mv_warp"]`. Melody-driven zoom breath (`mid_att_rel × 0.003`), valence rotation, decay=0.96, terrain-coherent UV ripple from bass (horizontal) and melody (vertical) at 0.004 UV amplitude.
- `Starburst (Murmuration)` — initially converted to `passes: ["mv_warp"]` (replacing `["feedback", "particles"]`) with bass breath zoom, melody rotation, decay=0.97 for long cloud smear. **Reverted per D-029** — current passes: `["feedback", "particles"]` per Starburst.json. The mv_warp conversion did not survive the paradigm analysis: particle systems already integrate state in world-space; stacking mv_warp over them double-integrates and smears particle trails into mush. The feedback+particles render path was restored. Stale `mvWarpPerFrame`/`mvWarpPerVertex` stubs were removed.

**Tests:** `MVWarpPipelineTests.swift` — identity warp test (seed red, assert output stays red) and accumulation test (10 frames with blue scene, assert red decays measurably).

---

### Increment D-030 — SpectralHistoryBuffer + SpectralCartograph ✅

New `SpectralHistoryBuffer` class (Shared module): 16 KB UMA MTLBuffer at fragment buffer index 5, bound unconditionally in all direct-pass fragment encoders. Maintains 5 ring buffers of 480 samples (≈8s at 60fps): valence, arousal, beat_phase01, bass_dev, and log-normalized vocal pitch. Updated once per frame in `RenderPipeline.draw(in:)`; reset on track change via `VisualizerEngine.resetStemPipeline(for:)`.

`SpectralCartograph` preset: first `instrument`-family preset. Four-panel real-time MIR diagnostic — TL=FFT spectrum (log-frequency, centroid-driven colour), TR=3-band deviation meters (D-026 compliant: reads only `*_att_rel` and `*_dev`), BL=valence/arousal phase plot with 8-second fading trail, BR=scrolling line graphs for `beat_phase01`, `bass_dev`, and `vocals_pitch_norm`. Direct pass only.

CLAUDE.md GPU Contract corrected: buffer(0)=FeatureVector (not FFT as previously documented). buffer(4)=SceneUniforms (ray march only, not future use). buffer(5)=SpectralHistory.

New `PresetCategory.instrument` case added.

15+ new tests across `SpectralHistoryBufferTests.swift`, `SpectralCartographTests.swift`, and additions to `RenderPipelineTests.swift`.

---

### Increment D-030b — Verification fixes + InputLevelMonitor ✅

Post-D-030 live-session verification (2026-04-20) found and fixed four issues:

**BeatPredictor timing bug (critical).** `beatPhase01` was always 0 in production. Root cause: `MIRPipeline.processAnalysisFrame` calls `mir.process(... time: 0 ...)` on every frame; `BeatPredictor.update()` accumulated timing via the `time` parameter, so `now = 0` always. First onset set `lastBeatTime = 0`; the subsequent `if lastBeatTime > 0` guard was false for `0.0`, so `hasPeriod` never became true. Fixed by internal `elapsedTime` accumulation from `deltaTime` (independent of `time`); guards changed `> 0` → `>= 0`. The `BeatPredictorTests.swift` bootstrap test was also updated to advance time frame-by-frame rather than via a single `time` jump (single calls only advance by one `dt` with the new accumulator).

**SpectralCartograph silent load.** The preset JSON was missing `"fragment_function": "spectral_cartograph_fragment"`. `PresetLoader` defaulted to `"preset_fragment"` which doesn't exist in the library, causing the preset to be silently skipped at load time.

**Swift 6 @MainActor warnings.** `MTKView.currentDrawable`, `currentRenderPassDescriptor`, and `drawableSize` are `@MainActor`-isolated; accessing them from nonisolated `draw(in:)` and helper methods produced ~18 Xcode IDE warnings. Fixed by annotating `draw(in:)`, `renderFrame`, `drawDirect`, `drawWithFeedback`, `drawParticleMode`, `drawSurfaceMode`, `drawWithICB`, `drawWithMeshShader`, `drawWithMVWarp`, `drawWithPostProcess`, `drawWithRayMarch` as `@MainActor`. The `@preconcurrency import MetalKit` already in each file suppresses any conformance mismatch for the protocol requirement.

**InputLevelMonitor** (new component). A live session (2026-04-17T19-31-46Z) routed through a Multi-Output Device (BlackHole + Mac mini Speakers) produced peaks at −20 dBFS with treble fraction at 0.1% — undetectable by the existing `SilenceDetector` (which only distinguishes silent/non-silent) or by post-AGC feature values (which normalise away absolute level). `InputLevelMonitor` measures peak dBFS (21s rolling window via `vDSP_maxmgv`) and 3-band spectral balance (EMAs on squared FFT magnitudes). Classification is peak-only after session 2026-04-17T21-05-47Z showed treble-ratio thresholds produced false positives on bass-heavy tracks (Oxytocin: 0.2% treble, clean chain). 30-frame hysteresis prevents log flapping. Quality transitions logged to session.log via `VisualizerEngine+Audio`; displayed in DebugOverlay.

Also: `MusicKitBridge` unused `artistLower` removed; `SessionRecorder` `_ = try? fh.seekToEnd()` to suppress unused `UInt64?` result.

343 tests, 5 pre-existing Apple Music failures. All 3 `BeatPredictorTests` now pass with correct phase tracking.

---

## Immediate Next Increments

These are ordered by dependency. Each has done-when criteria and verification commands.

> **Capability Audit (Phase CA, 2026-05-20).** The originally-planned `docs/CAPABILITY_GAP_AUDIT.md` single-deliverable was superseded 2026-05-20 by the multi-increment **Phase CA** audit, which produces one per-subsystem registry under [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/). CA.1 (DSP/MIR) landed 2026-05-20 at [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/DSP_MIR.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/DSP_MIR.md); CA.2+ pending. Preliminary 2026-05-12 inventory data (shader-utility-consumer matrix, distinct from CA's per-subsystem audits) lives at [`docs/diagnostics/capability-audit-pre-2026-05-12.md`](diagnostics/capability-audit-pre-2026-05-12.md) and continues to feed shader-cleanup increments.

**Current priority ordering (post-2026-05-06 multi-agent codebase review):**

1. **Phase QR — Quality Review Remediation** (QR.1 → QR.6). New top priority. QR.1 → QR.4 are sequenced; QR.5 + QR.6 run after QR.1–QR.4 land. See "Phase QR" section below.
2. **Phase DSP — DSP Hardening.** DSP.3.7 (Live drift validation test) merges into QR.3.
3. **Phase V — Visual Fidelity Uplift** (V.5 reference completion + V.7.7B WORLD pillar) — can run in parallel with QR since they touch disjoint modules.
4. **Phase MD — Milkdrop Ingestion** (MD.1 → MD.7). Unchanged dependency on V.1–V.3 utilities.
5. **Phase SB — Starburst Fidelity Uplift** (SB.1 → SB.5). Independent.

Phase U / Phase 4 / Phase 5 / Phase 6 / Phase 7 / Phase MV all complete; see historical records below.

## Phase MV — Milkdrop-Informed Musical Architecture

**Why this phase exists:** six iterations on Volumetric Lithograph produced incremental fixes but never converged on "feels like a band member playing along with the music." [`docs/MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE.md`](MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE.md) documents the research that identified the root cause:

1. Milkdrop's audio vocabulary is **identical in scope to what Phosphene already computes** — no chord recognition, no pitch tracking, no stems. Our analysis pipeline is richer than theirs.
2. Milkdrop's `bass`/`bass_att` are **AGC-normalized ratios centered at 1.0**. Phosphene's are centered at 0.5 via the same AGC mechanism. But our presets have been authored with absolute thresholds — the wrong primitive for an AGC signal. Absolute thresholds inherently fail across tracks because the AGC divisor moves with mix density.
3. Milkdrop's "musical feel" comes from its **per-vertex feedback warp architecture**, not its audio analysis. Every preset warps the previous frame via a 32×24 grid, and motion *accumulates* over many frames. Simple audio inputs compound into rich organic motion.
4. **9 of 11 Phosphene presets did not use any feedback loop** prior to MV-2 — they rendered from scratch each frame. Ray-march presets in particular showed only instantaneous audio state. This is why they felt "disconnected" from music regardless of how cleverly tuned.

MV-0 ✅, MV-1 ✅, MV-2 ✅, MV-3 ✅ complete.

### Increment MV-3 — Beyond-Milkdrop extensions ✅

**MV-3a — Richer per-stem metadata** ✅
- `StemFeatures` expanded 32→64 floats (128→256 bytes). New per-stem fields: `{vocals,drums,bass,other}{OnsetRate, Centroid, AttackRatio, EnergySlope}` (floats 25–40), computed in `StemAnalyzer.analyze()` via `computeRichFeatures()`.
- `StemAnalyzerMV3Tests.swift`: click vs sine distinguishes attackRatio; silence gives zeros; 120-BPM click track mean onsetRate in [1.0, 3.5]/sec.

**MV-3b — Next-beat phase predictor** ✅
- New `BeatPredictor` class (IIR period estimation from onset rising edges). Feeds `beatPhase01` and `beatsUntilNext` into `FeatureVector` floats 35–36. Integrated in `MIRPipeline.buildFeatureVector()`.
- `BeatPredictorTests.swift`: phase monotonically rises 0→1; phase resets after 3× period silence; bootstrap BPM gives correct phase.
- `VolumetricLithograph.metal` updated: `approachFrac = max(0, (f.beat_phase01 - 0.80) / 0.20)` pre-beat anticipatory zoom.

**MV-3c — Vocal pitch tracking** ✅
- New `PitchTracker` (YIN autocorrelation, vDSP_dotpr). Key fix: advance to local CMNDF minimum before parabolic interpolation (finding just the first sub-threshold point causes catastrophic extrapolation on the descending slope). 80–1000 Hz gate, 0.6 confidence threshold, EMA decay 0.8.
- Feeds `vocalsPitchHz` and `vocalsPitchConfidence` into `StemFeatures` floats 41–42.
- `PitchTrackerTests.swift`: 440 Hz and 220 Hz within 5 cents; silence → 0 Hz; random noise → unvoiced.
- `VolumetricLithograph.metal` updated: `vl_pitchHueShift()` maps pitch to ±0.15 palette phase shift; gated by confidence ≥ 0.6.

**Explicitly NOT part of MV-3 (still out of scope):**
- Basic Pitch port, chord recognition via Tonic, HTDemucs swap, Sound Analysis framework

---

## Phase 4 — Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is the product's key differentiator. It is implemented as an explicit scoring and policy system, not a black box.

### Increment 4.0 — Enriched Preset Metadata Schema ✅

**Scope:** `PresetMetadata.swift` (new), `PresetDescriptor.swift` (extended), all 11 JSON sidecars back-filled.

Pulled forward from Phase 5.1 because Increment 4.1 (PresetScorer) cannot be built without the metadata it scores on. Adding the schema now eliminates a breaking change immediately after 4.1 is drafted.

**New types:** `FatigueRisk`, `TransitionAffordance`, `SongSection` (String-raw, Codable, Sendable, Hashable, CaseIterable). `ComplexityCost` struct with dual-form Codable (scalar or `{"tier1":x,"tier2":y}`). All in `PresetMetadata.swift`.

**New `PresetDescriptor` fields (all optional in JSON, fallback-on-missing, warn-on-malformed):**
`visual_density`, `motion_intensity`, `color_temperature_range`, `fatigue_risk`, `transition_affordances`, `section_suitability`, `complexity_cost`.

**Done when:** ✅ All criteria met.
- `PresetMetadata.swift` with three enums and `ComplexityCost`, all correct Swift 6 types.
- `PresetDescriptor` has 7 new fields; decoding falls back to defaults; unknown `fatigue_risk` logs warning + uses `.medium`.
- All 11 built-in preset JSON sidecars have explicit values for all 7 new fields.
- `PresetLoaderBuiltInPresetsHaveValidPipelines` regression gate still passes.
- `PresetDescriptorMetadataTests`: round-trip, defaults, malformed, complexity variants (scalar + nested), on-disk back-fill regression (6 test functions).
- D-029 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. CLAUDE.md preset metadata table extended.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetDescriptorMetadataTests`

---

### Increment L-1 — Structural SwiftLint Cleanup

**Scope:** Refactor 12 source files to eliminate all 24 remaining structural SwiftLint violations. No logic changes — pure mechanical refactoring. Verified by `swiftlint lint --strict` reporting 0 violations on active source paths, with all tests still passing.

**Background:** After the 2026-04-20 auto-fix pass, 24 structural violations remain (down from 166). These are `file_length`, `function_body_length`, `cyclomatic_complexity`, `type_body_length`, `large_tuple`, and `line_length` — rules that require file splits or helper extraction rather than auto-correction.

**Violations and fix strategy (file:line:rule):**

| File | Line | Rule | Fix |
|------|------|------|-----|
| `SessionRecorder.swift` | 46 | type_body_length (516) | Split to `SessionRecorder+Video.swift` (Video encoding MARK), `SessionRecorder+RawTap.swift` (Raw tap diagnostic MARK), `SessionRecorder+WAV.swift` (WAV writing) |
| `SessionRecorder.swift` | 150 | function_body_length (72) | Extract `setupWriters()`, `setupVideoWriter()`, `setupAudioWriter()` private helpers from `init` |
| `SessionRecorder.swift` | 397 | cyclomatic_complexity (13) + function_body_length (72) | Extract `handleVideoWriterInit()` and `handleFrameDimensionMismatch()` private helpers from `appendVideoFrame()` |
| `SessionRecorder.swift` | 793 | file_length (793) | Resolved by the type_body_length split above |
| `AudioFeatures+Analyzed.swift` | 552 | file_length (552) | Move `StemFeatures` struct (lines ~323–514) to new `StemFeatures.swift` in same directory |
| `PresetLoader+Preamble.swift` | 541 | file_length (541) | Split MV-warp preamble (line ~199 MARK) to `PresetLoader+WarpPreamble.swift` |
| `StemAnalyzer.swift` | 171 | function_body_length (96) | Extract `buildBaseFeatures()` and `applyDeviationPrimitives()` private helpers from `analyze()` |
| `StemAnalyzer.swift` | 349 | large_tuple | Define `StemRichFeatures` struct `{onsetRate, centroid, attackRatio, energySlope: Float}` to replace 4-member named tuple return from `computeRichFeatures()` |
| `StemAnalyzer.swift` | 500 | file_length (500) | Resolved by helper extraction above |
| `PitchTracker.swift` | 97 | cyclomatic_complexity (15) + function_body_length (86) | Extract 5 private helpers: `fillWindow()`, `computeDifference()`, `computeCMNDF()`, `findMinimum()`, `parabolicInterpolation()` from `process(waveform:)` |
| `MIRPipeline.swift` | 407 | file_length (407, 7 over) | Extract `buildFeatureVector()` deviation block to a private helper; or remove excess blank lines |
| `AudioInputRouter.swift` | 423 | file_length (423, 23 over) | Extract `Signal-State Handling + Tap Reinstall` MARK section to `AudioInputRouter+SignalState.swift` |
| `PresetLoader.swift` | 449 | function_body_length (103) | Extract `compilePipeline(for:)` and `compileRayMarchPipeline(for:)` private helpers from `loadPreset()` |
| `RayMarchPipeline.swift` | 184 | function_body_length (71) | Extract `makeGBufferTextures()` and `makeLightingPipeline()` private helpers from `init` |
| `RayMarchPipeline.swift` | 415 | file_length (415, 15 over) | Resolved by init helper extraction above |
| `RenderPipeline+Draw.swift` | 448 | file_length (448, 48 over) | Extract `drawWithICB` and `drawWithParticles` to `RenderPipeline+Particles.swift` |
| `RenderPipeline+RayMarch.swift` | 81 | function_body_length (83) | Extract `buildSceneUniforms()` and `applyAudioModulation()` private helpers |
| `RenderPipeline.swift` | 475 | file_length (475, 75 over) | Extract `PassManagement` MARK section to `RenderPipeline+Passes.swift` |
| `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift` | 507 | file_length (507, 107 over) | Extract `InputLevelMonitor` integration section to `VisualizerEngine+InputLevel.swift` |
| `VisualizerEngine.swift` | 245 | function_body_length (82) | Extract `setupAudio()`, `setupRenderer()`, `setupCapture()` private helpers from `init` |
| `VisualizerEngine.swift` | 473 | file_length (473, 73 over) | Resolved by init helper extraction above |
| `InputLevelMonitor.swift` | 267 | line_length (127 chars) | Break `String(format:)` argument across lines or shorten message |

**Constraints:**
- No logic changes whatsoever. Every extracted function/struct must preserve byte-for-byte identical observable behavior.
- No new public API surface. All extracted helpers are `private`.
- New files added to the same target as the file being split (no new SPM targets).
- When splitting a file, all `// MARK: -` dividers from the original stay with their section.
- `StemRichFeatures` replacing the named tuple: must update all call sites in `StemAnalyzer.swift`; no other files reference the tuple directly.
- All existing tests must pass before and after each file change.

**Done when:**
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml PhospheneEngine/Sources/ PhospheneEngine/Tests/ PhospheneApp/` reports **0 violations**.
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` passes (all tests green).
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build` succeeds with 0 errors.

**Verify:**
```bash
swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml PhospheneEngine/Sources/ PhospheneEngine/Tests/ PhospheneApp/
swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine
```

### Increment 4.1 — Preset Scoring Model ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20.

`DefaultPresetScorer` implements the `PresetScoring` protocol with four weighted sub-scores (mood 0.30, stemAffinity 0.25, sectionSuitability 0.25, tempoMotion 0.20) and two multiplicative penalties (family-repeat 0.2×, smoothstep fatigue cooldown 60/120/300s). Hard exclusions gate perf-budget breakers and identity matches before scoring. `PresetScoreBreakdown` exposes every sub-score for introspection. `PresetScoringContext` is a fully Sendable value-type snapshot with a monotonic session clock — no `Date.now()` inside the scorer. 13 unit tests cover all contract edges including determinism, exclusion, cooldown, and rank stability across device tiers. See D-032 in DECISIONS.md for weight rationale.

**New files:** `Orchestrator/PresetScorer.swift`, `Orchestrator/PresetScoringContext.swift`, `Shared/DeviceTier.swift`. Extended: `PresetDescriptor` (added `stemAffinity: [String: String]`), `ComplexityCost` (added `cost(for:)` helper), `Package.swift` (added `Session` dep to `Orchestrator` target, `Orchestrator` dep to test target).

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetScorerTests`

---

### Increment 4.2 — Transition Policy ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20.

`DefaultTransitionPolicy` implements the `TransitionDeciding` protocol. Priority: structural boundary (when `StructuralPrediction.confidence ≥ 0.5` and boundary within 2.5 s lookahead window) beats duration-expired timer fallback. `TransitionDecision` is fully inspectable: trigger, scheduledAt, style (crossfade/cut/morph), duration, confidence, rationale. Style negotiated from `currentPreset.transitionAffordances` and energy level — high energy (> 0.7) prefers `.cut`, low energy prefers `.crossfade`. Crossfade duration scales linearly from 2.0 s (energy=0) to 0.5 s (energy=1). Family-repeat avoidance is already handled upstream by `DefaultPresetScorer` (familyRepeatMultiplier=0.2×). 12 unit tests with synthetic `StructuralPrediction` inputs — all pass. See D-033 in DECISIONS.md.

**New files:** `Orchestrator/TransitionPolicy.swift`, `Tests/Orchestrator/TransitionPolicyTests.swift`.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine`

---

### Increment 4.3 — Session Planner ✅

**Scope:** `Orchestrator/SessionPlanner.swift`, `Orchestrator/PlannedSession.swift`. Greedy forward-walk planner composing `DefaultPresetScorer` + `DefaultTransitionPolicy`. Produces a `PlannedSession` — ordered list of `PlannedTrack` entries each carrying the selected `PresetDescriptor`, `PresetScoreBreakdown`, `PlannedTransition`, and planned timing. `planAsync` accepts a precompile closure (caller-injected, keeps Orchestrator module free of Renderer dependency). Deterministic: same inputs → byte-identical output. `PlanningWarning` surfaces degradation events. SessionManager integration deferred: `Session` module cannot import `Orchestrator` without a circular dependency — app-layer wiring is Increment 4.5.

**Landed 2026-04-20.** 13 unit tests covering empty-playlist/empty-catalog errors, single-track plan, 5-track family diversity, tier exclusion, mood arc, fatigue, full-exclusion fallback, determinism, `track(at:)` / `transition(at:)` lookups, precompile dedup, and precompile failure handling. D-034 in DECISIONS.md. 387 tests total; 4 pre-existing Apple Music env failures unchanged.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter SessionPlannerTests`

---

### Increment 4.4 — Golden Session Test Fixtures ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20. *(Current state: regenerated multiple times since landing — QR.2 stem-affinity rescaling, V.7.6.2 multi-segment, BUG-004 closure 2026-05-12 expanding catalog 11 → 15 presets and adding Session D for Lumen Mosaic eligibility coverage. The current test file in `PhospheneEngine/Tests/.../Orchestrator/GoldenSessionTests.swift` is authoritative; the original-landing description below is preserved as a historical record.)*

`GoldenSessionTests.swift` — 12 regression tests across three curated playlists that lock in the expected Orchestrator output for any given set of track profiles and the full 11-preset production catalog. Any future change to `DefaultPresetScorer`, `DefaultTransitionPolicy`, `DefaultSessionPlanner`, or a preset JSON sidecar that breaks a golden test is a regression; the test file must be updated with a scoring trace comment that proves the new expected values are correct.

**Session A (high-energy electronic, 5 × 180 s, BPM=130, val=0.7, arous=0.8):** VL→Plasma→VL→FO→VL. Transitions from VL are cuts (VL carries `[crossfade, cut]` affordances, energy=0.82 > 0.7 threshold); transitions from Plasma/FO are crossfades at ~0.77 s.

**Session B (mellow jazz, 5 × 180 s, BPM=85, val=0.3, arous=−0.3):** VL→GB→VL→GB→VL. All crossfades at ~1.43 s (energy=0.38). No high-motion preset (Murmuration motion=0.85) ever wins.

**Session C (genre-diverse, 6 tracks, varied durations):** VL→GB→VL→Plasma→VL→FO. Covers 4 families (fluid, geometric, hypnotic, abstract).

**Key implementation decisions:**
- `allBreakdowns: [(PresetDescriptor, PresetScoreBreakdown)]` was **not** added to `PlannedTrack`. Runner-up inspection is done by calling `DefaultPresetScorer().breakdown(preset:track:context:)` directly inside the test body — no new public API.
- `PlannedTransition` carries no `trigger` enum field; trigger type is verified via `reason.hasPrefix("Structural boundary")`.
- Two pre-implementation spec derivation errors were caught and corrected against the code: Plasma (0.803) beats Ferrofluid Ocean (0.793) in high-energy electronic sessions because Plasma's tempCenter (0.6) is closer to targetTemp (0.78). The spec's scoring trace omitted Plasma when listing non-fluid competitors.

399 tests total; 4 pre-existing Apple Music env failures unchanged.

### Increment 4.5 — Live Adaptation ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20.

`LiveAdapter.swift` + `LiveAdapter+Patching.swift` + `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift`. `DefaultLiveAdapter` implementing `LiveAdapting` protocol with two adaptation paths (boundary reschedule > mood override). `PlannedSession.applying(_:at:)` extension for controlled plan mutation from the app layer. `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator` holds `livePlan` (NSLock-guarded) and provides `buildPlan()`, `currentPreset(at:)`, `currentTransition(at:)`, `applyLiveUpdate(...)`.

**Boundary reschedule:** fires when `StructuralPrediction.confidence ≥ 0.5` AND the live boundary deviates from the planned transition time by > 5 s. 5 s = 2× the `LookaheadBuffer` 2.5 s window — deviations smaller than that are within normal preview-vs-live jitter. Wins over mood override when both conditions fire simultaneously.

**Mood override:** fires only when all three hold: `|Δvalence| > 0.4 || |Δarousal| > 0.4`, elapsed fraction < 40%, and the best-scoring alternative preset is > 0.15 higher. Current preset scored without exclusion (true live score); alternatives scored with current preset excluded. Cap at 40% prevents churn in the back half of a track.

**Key implementation decisions (D-035):**
- `LiveAdaptation.PresetOverride` is a nested struct (not a named tuple) for `Sendable` conformance in Swift 6 strict mode.
- `PlannedSession.applying` lives in `LiveAdapter+Patching.swift` (same Orchestrator module as the internal memberwise inits of `PlannedSession`/`PlannedTrack`) — the only controlled mutation path outside of `DefaultSessionPlanner.plan()`.
- Empty `recentHistory: []` in live scoring context is intentional — fatigueMultiplier is a session-level pre-plan concern; live overrides that fire mid-track should not re-apply session-level fatigue logic.
- `LiveAdapting` protocol uses `// swiftlint:disable function_parameter_count` (6 params) — wrapping into a context struct would add an intermediate allocation on the hot path with no modelling benefit.

**Test notes:**
- `noBoundarySignal()` helper (confidence=0.0) bypasses the boundary path in mood-only tests. Using `closeBoundary(at: N)` in mood tests caused unexpected boundary reschedules because the live session boundary deviated > 5 s from the planned transition time even when confidence was high.
- Override catalog uses `visual_density` JSON field (`case visualDensity = "visual_density"` in `PresetDescriptor.CodingKeys`) — confirmed before writing test helpers.
- Scoring math verified by hand: pre-analyzed sad/calm (-0.5, -0.5) → targetTemp=0.30; CurrentPreset (center=0.25, density=0.25) → mood score 0.95. Live happy/energetic (0.7, 0.7) → targetTemp=0.78; AltPreset (center=0.78, density=0.78) → mood score 1.0. Gap = 0.875 − 0.716 = 0.159 > 0.15 threshold.

407 tests total; 4 pre-existing Apple Music env failures unchanged.

### Increment 4.6 — Ad-Hoc Reactive Mode ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20

**What was built:**
- `ReactiveOrchestrator.swift` — `ReactiveAccumulationState` (listening/ramping/full), `ReactiveDecision`, `ReactiveOrchestrating` protocol, `DefaultReactiveOrchestrator` (stateless pure function). Confidence ramps 0→0.3 over first 15 s, 0.3→1.0 over 15–30 s, 1.0 after. Switch conditions: score gap > 0.20 OR structural boundary confidence ≥ 0.5.
- `ReactiveOrchestratorTests.swift` — 8 unit tests: listening hold, confidence ramp, ramping suggestion, score-gap suppression, boundary override, boundary scheduling, nil-preset path, empty-catalog hold.
- `VisualizerEngine.swift` — added `reactiveOrchestrator`, `reactiveSessionStart`, `lastReactiveSwitchTime`.
- `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift` — `applyLiveUpdate()` routes to `applyReactiveUpdate()` when `livePlan == nil`; `buildPlan()` clears `reactiveSessionStart` when a real plan arrives. 60 s cooldown prevents switch-thrashing.
- D-036 added to `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Key decisions:** D-036 — stateless orchestrator, app-layer owns cooldown and wall-clock elapsed time.

**Tests:** 407 → 415 (8 new). Same 4 pre-existing Apple Music environment failures.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter ReactiveOrchestratorTests`

## Phase 5 — Preset Certification Pipeline

### Increment 5.1 — Enriched Preset Metadata Schema ✅ (landed as Increment 4.0)

**Note:** This increment was pulled forward and completed as **Increment 4.0** because PresetScorer (Increment 4.1) requires this schema before it can be drafted. See Increment 4.0 above for the full done-when criteria and verification commands. All 5.1 scope items are complete.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine`

---

### Increment 5.2 — Preset Acceptance Checklist (Automated) ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20

**What was built:**
- `PresetAcceptanceTests.swift` — 4 parametrized invariant tests across all production presets (44 test cases when bundle resources are linked):
  1. Non-black at silence (max channel > 10).
  2. No white clip on steady energy for non-HDR passes (max < 250).
  3. Beat response ≤ 2× continuous response + 1.0 tolerance (enforces CLAUDE.md audio data hierarchy).
  4. Form complexity ≥ 2 at silence (detects visually dead single-bin outputs).
- Four FeatureVector fixtures derived from AGC semantics and CLAUDE.md reference onset table (Love Rehab ~125 BPM, Miles Davis ~136 BPM). Not synthetic envelopes.
- `renderFrame` renders 64×64 offscreen via the preset's direct `pipelineState`. Ray march and post-process presets are rendered via their composite output; the `post_process` white-clip check is skipped (HDR values are legal before tone-mapping).
- `_acceptanceFixture` is a module-level constant loaded once; if bundle resources are absent, it returns `[]` (zero test cases rather than failure).

**Key decision:** D-037 — structural invariants over GPU output; perceptual snapshot regression deferred to 5.3.

**Tests:** 415 → 419 (4 new @Test functions; Swift Testing counts @Test declarations, not parametrized cases). Same 4 pre-existing Apple Music environment failures.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetAcceptanceTests`

---

### Increment 5.3 — Visual Regression Snapshots ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21

**What was built:**
- `PresetRegressionTests.swift` — 3 parametrized regression tests (steady, beat-heavy, quiet) + 1 golden-generation utility test.
- 64-bit dHash computed via 9×8 luma grid + horizontal-difference encoding (`computeLumaGrid` + `dHash`).
- `goldenPresetHashes` dictionary: 11 preset entries × 3 fixtures = 33 comparisons. Fractal Tree excluded (meshShader).
- Hamming distance ≤ 8 tolerance (87.5% match). Missing entries skip silently (safe for new presets).
- `UPDATE_GOLDEN_SNAPSHOTS=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter test_printGoldenHashes` regenerates all values.
- Same buffer/skip infrastructure as Increment 5.2 (SceneUniforms for ray march, zeroed FFT/stems/history).
- `_acceptanceFixture` and `PresetFixtureContext` promoted from `private` to `internal` in `PresetAcceptanceTests.swift` so `PresetRegressionTests.swift` can reference them directly.

**Key decision:** D-039 — dHash regression gate; hardware caveat documented.

**Tests:** 435 → 439 (4 new @Test functions). Same pre-existing failures unchanged.

**Verify:**
```bash
swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetRegressionTests
# To regenerate goldens:
UPDATE_GOLDEN_SNAPSHOTS=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter test_printGoldenHashes
```

## Phase U — UX Architecture

**Why this phase exists:** the engine has a `SessionState` lifecycle (idle → connecting → preparing → ready → playing → ended) and a developer-facing debug overlay, but there is no user-facing UX specification and no corresponding UI. Phase 2.5 built the preparation *pipeline*; Phase U builds the UI around it. `docs/UX_SPEC.md` is the canonical spec for everything in this phase. Milestone A ("Trustworthy Playback Session") blocks on U.1–U.7.

### Increment U.1 — Session-state views ✅

**Scope:** `ContentView` becomes a pure switch on `SessionManager.state`. Six stub top-level views (`IdleView`, `ConnectingView`, `PreparationProgressView`, `ReadyView`, `PlaybackView`, `EndedView`) under `PhospheneApp/Views/`, each rendering a distinct testable hierarchy. `SessionStateViewModel` (`@MainActor ObservableObject`) observes `SessionManager` and publishes current state. New `CLAUDE.md §UX Contract` section. New `ARCHITECTURE.md §UI Layer` subsection.

**Done when:**
- ✅ Six views exist; each renders without errors for its corresponding state.
- ✅ `ContentView` contains no state logic beyond routing.
- ✅ Tests for each view — 9 tests across 3 suites in `PhospheneAppTests/SessionStateViewTests.swift`.
- ✅ Reduced-motion system flag detection stub in place (used by later increments).

**Implementation note:** Accessibility ID testing via SwiftUI's accessibility tree traversal is unreliable in unit tests — macOS only materialises the SwiftUI accessibility tree for active clients (VoiceOver, XCUITest). Each view exposes `static let accessibilityID: String`; `.accessibilityIdentifier(Self.accessibilityID)` binds it in the view body. Tests check the static constants; the binding is enforced by construction. See D-044.

**Verify:** `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' test` — 9 new tests pass.

---

### Increment U.2 — Permission onboarding ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-22

**What was built:**
- `PermissionMonitor` (`@MainActor ObservableObject`) observing
  `NSApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification`, backed by
  `ScreenCapturePermissionProviding`.
- `SystemScreenCapturePermissionProvider` (production) — `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess`.
  Never calls `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess` (system dialog doesn't compose with URL-scheme flow).
- `PhotosensitivityAcknowledgementStore` — injectable `UserDefaults` suite; key
  `phosphene.onboarding.photosensitivityAcknowledged`.
- `PermissionOnboardingView` per UX_SPEC §3.2; opens
  `x-apple.systempreferences:…?Privacy_ScreenCapture` via `NSWorkspace.shared.open`.
  No Retry button — return-detection is automatic via `PermissionMonitor`.
- `PhotosensitivityNoticeView` per UX_SPEC §3.3; surfaced as a `.sheet` on
  first `IdleView` appearance.
- `ContentView` refactored to two-level switch: permission gate above state switch.
  `PermissionMonitor` injected as `@EnvironmentObject` from `PhospheneApp`.
- `IdleView` updated with `.onAppear` + `.sheet(isPresented:)` for the notice.

**Key decisions:**
- Preflight + URL scheme, NOT `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()` — the request
  API's system dialog doesn't compose with "Open System Settings and return."
- Permission gate lives above the state switch, not inside `SessionStateViewModel` —
  permission routing outranks session state per UX_SPEC §3.1.
- Photosensitivity sheet on `IdleView`, not a separate top-level state — timing
  is "after permission, before first session" which maps exactly to `IdleView`'s
  first appearance.
- `PermissionMonitor` lives under `Permissions/`, not `Views/` — it is a
  routing-layer concern, not a view.

**Tests:** 535 → 549 (+14 new: 5 PermissionMonitor, 4 PhotosensitivityStore, 5 PermissionOnboarding). Pre-existing failures unchanged.

**Verify:**
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine`
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' test`
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml`

---

### Increment U.3 — Playlist connector picker ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-23

**What was built:**
- `ConnectorType` enum (appleMusic/spotify/localFolder) with title/subtitle/systemImage.
- `ConnectorTileView`: reusable tile with enabled/disabled states and optional secondary
  action button.
- `ConnectorPickerViewModel` (`@MainActor ObservableObject`): NSWorkspace launch/terminate
  observers with `nonisolated(unsafe)` storage — the only correct pattern for observers
  that must be removed in `deinit` on a `@MainActor` class (Swift 6 `deinit` is nonisolated).
  250ms debounce on Apple Music availability.
- `ConnectorPickerView`: `NavigationStack` inside a `.sheet` from `IdleView`, with
  `navigationDestination(for: ConnectorType.self)`.
- `AppleMusicConnectionViewModel`: five-state machine
  (idle/connecting/noCurrentPlaylist/notRunning/permissionDenied/error/connected).
  Auto-retry on `.noCurrentPlaylist` via injectable `DelayProviding` (2s real, instant
  in tests). Pre-flight finding: AppleScript error -1728 (no track) and -1743 (automation
  denied) both silently return an empty array — indistinguishable in U.3.
- `AppleMusicConnectionView`: five user-visible states with CTA copy per UX_SPEC §4.3.
  `.onChange(of: viewModel.state)` fires `onConnect(.appleMusicCurrentPlaylist)` on
  `.connected`.
- `SpotifyURLKind` + `SpotifyURLParser`: pure value types. Handles HTTPS, `spotify:` URI,
  `@`-prefixed links, query param stripping, podcast paths → `.invalid`.
- `SpotifyConnectionViewModel`: 300ms debounce on text input via `$text.sink`; HTTP 429
  retry with [2s, 5s, 15s] backoff (extracted to `retryAfterRateLimit` to satisfy
  `cyclomatic_complexity ≤ 10`). `.spotifyAuthRequired` → calls `startSession` directly
  (SessionManager degrades gracefully to live-only reactive mode; no OAuth in U.3).
- `SpotifyConnectionView`: URL paste field, playlist-ID preview card, per-kind rejection
  copy, retry-attempt indicator.
- `DelayProviding` protocol: `RealDelay` (wall-clock `Task.sleep`) and `InstantDelay`
  (`await Task.yield()` — yields actor without wall-clock wait, enabling fast retry tests).
- `LocalFolderConnector` stub: `#if ENABLE_LOCAL_FOLDER_CONNECTOR` compile flag; always
  throws `.networkFailure("not yet implemented")`.
- `IdleView` updated: "Connect a playlist" → `.sheet`, "Start listening now" → ad-hoc
  session. `PhospheneApp.swift` auto-start `startAdHocSession()` removed from `.onAppear`.

**Key decisions (D-046):**
- `nonisolated(unsafe)` for NSWorkspace observer storage in `@MainActor` classes.
- `ConnectorPickerView` as sheet-with-NavigationStack (not a new NavigationStack root).
- `DelayProviding` protocol for testable retry without wall-clock waits.
- `.spotifyAuthRequired` silently degrades — no user-visible error since the session still
  starts (live-only reactive mode is valid and useful without OAuth).

**Tests:** 21 new PhospheneApp tests (ConnectorPickerViewModelTests×9, SpotifyURLParserTests×12,
AppleMusicConnectionViewModelTests×5 + identifier, SpotifyConnectionViewModelTests×5 + identifier).
56 PhospheneApp tests total. 0 SwiftLint violations.

**Verify:**
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' test`
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml`

---

### Increment U.4 — Preparation progress UI ✅

**Scope:** `PreparationProgressView` per `UX_SPEC.md §5.2`. New `PreparationProgressPublishing` protocol exposed by `SessionPreparer`; publishes `[TrackID: TrackPreparationStatus]` via Combine. `TrackPreparationRow` renders one of seven statuses (`.queued`, `.resolving`, `.downloading`, `.analyzing`, `.ready`, `.partial`, `.failed`) with icon + copy per `§5.3` table. Aggregate progress bar + per-track ETA + cancel affordance. "Start now" CTA appears at `progressiveReadinessLevel == .ready_for_first_tracks` — dependency on Increment 6.1; before 6.1 ships, this CTA is dormant.

**Done when:**
- Track list updates as each track advances through preparation stages.
- `PreparationProgressPublishing` protocol defined in `Session` module; `DefaultSessionPreparer` conforms.
- All seven status cases render correctly with their icons and copy.
- Cancel tears down in-flight work and returns to `.idle` without leaving orphan stem analyses.
- 6+ unit tests, including a flaky-network fixture via `MockPreparationProgressPublisher`.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PreparationProgressTests`

---

### Increment U.5 — Ready view + first-audio autodetect ✅

**Scope:** `ReadyView` per `UX_SPEC.md §6.1`. First-track preset renders in background at 0.3× opacity. Attention-drawing pulsing border. First-audio autodetect via `AudioInputRouter` `.silent → .active` transition sustained >250 ms → auto-advance to `.playing`. 90-second timeout handling per `§6.3`. Plan preview panel (`PlanPreviewView`) showing all `PlannedTrack` rows with transitions. Regenerate Plan (D-047) with random seed + manual-lock preservation.

**Delivered:**
- Part A: `ReadyView`, `ReadyViewModel`, `FirstAudioDetector`, `ReadyPulsingBorder`, `ReadyBackgroundPresetView`.
- Part B: `PlanPreviewView`, `PlanPreviewViewModel`, `PlanPreviewRowView`, `PlanPreviewTransitionView`.
- Part C: `PresetPreviewController` stub — deferred to U.5b (D-048).
- Part D: `DefaultSessionPlanner.plan(seed:)`, `PlannedSession.applying(overrides:)`, `VisualizerEngine.regeneratePlan(lockedTracks:lockedPresets:)`.
- 19 new tests: `FirstAudioDetectorTests`, `ReadyViewModelTests`, `PlanPreviewViewModelTests`, `PlanPreviewRegenerateTests`, `ReadyViewTimeoutIntegrationTests`, `SessionPlannerSeedTests`.

---

### Increment U.5b — Preset preview loop (deferred from U.5 Part C)

**Scope:** 10-second looping preset preview triggered by row-tap in `PlanPreviewView`. Currently a no-op stub in `PresetPreviewController`. Full implementation requires engine-layer changes: (1) synthetic `FeatureVector` injection into active `RenderPipeline`; (2) secondary render surface or background-preset surface hijack; (3) loop mechanism without live audio callbacks. See D-048.

**Done when:**
- Row tap in `PlanPreviewView` triggers a looping 10s preview of the row's preset.
- Tap again or session advance stops the preview and reverts to the session's active preset.
- Context-menu "Swap preset" is enabled and wired to `PlanPreviewViewModel.swapPreset(for:to:)`.
- `PresetPreviewController.startPreview(preset:stems:)` drives the RenderPipeline, not a stub.
- 6+ unit tests for preview controller lifecycle + integration test for row-tap → visual change.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetPreviewTests`

---

### Increment U.5c — Plan modification editor (deferred from U.5 Part C)

**Scope:** Preset picker for manual swap in `PlanPreviewView`. The "Modify" footer button and context-menu "Swap preset" action open a picker sheet showing the preset catalog filtered to eligible candidates for the selected track. Currently disabled with `TODO(U.5.C)` markers.

**Done when:**
- "Swap preset" context-menu action opens a preset picker for the selected track.
- Picker shows eligible presets filtered by device tier and fatigue cooldown.
- Selecting a preset calls `PlanPreviewViewModel.swapPreset(for:to:)` and shows lock badge.
- "Modify" footer button opens the same picker for the last-tapped row.
- 4+ unit tests for picker filtering + view model lock state after swap.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PlanModifyTests`

---

### Increment U.6 — In-session chrome ✅

**Scope:** `PlaybackView` overlay chrome per `UX_SPEC.md §7`. Three layers: Metal render surface (full-bleed), auto-hiding overlay (track info top-left, controls cluster top-right, bottom-right toast slot), debug overlay (toggled with `D`). `OverlayChromeView` with `PlaybackOverlayViewModel` managing visibility + fade timers. Keyboard shortcuts from `§7.6` registered globally within `.playing`. Track-change animation per `§7.5`. Multi-display drag per `§7.7`. Blurred dark backdrop for contrast guarantee.

**Done when:**
- Overlay fades out after 3 s idle; reappears on mouse move or key press.
- Keyboard shortcuts `⌘F`, `Space`, `←`, `→`, `M`, `D`, `Esc`, `?` all wired.
- Track change triggers center toast for 1 s then moves info to top-left card.
- Minimum-contrast 4.5:1 verified against three regression fixtures (silence / steady mid-energy / beat-heavy).
- Display hot-plug reparents window without crash or session loss.
- 8+ unit tests for ViewModel state transitions + snapshot tests for each overlay configuration.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PlaybackChromeTests`

---

### Increment U.6b — Live adaptation keyboard shortcut semantics ✅

**Status: Complete (2026-04-25)**

**What was built:**
- `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter` fully wired — all seven methods (`moreLikeThis`, `lessLikeThis`, `reshuffleUpcoming`, `presetNudge`, `rePlanSession`, `undoLastAdaptation`, `toggleMoodLock`) produce observable state changes. No remaining `TODO(U.6b)` lines.
- `PresetScoringContext` extended with `familyBoosts`, `temporarilyExcludedFamilies`, `sessionExcludedPresets` (all defaulted empty; D-053 backward-compat discipline).
- `PresetScoreBreakdown.familyBoost: Float` added; `DefaultPresetScorer` honours all three new fields.
- `PlannedSession.extendingCurrentPreset(by:at:)` added in `LiveAdapter+Patching` (same controlled-mutation discipline as `applying(_:at:)`).
- `PresetCategory.displayName` computed property for user-facing toast copy.
- `LiveAdaptationToastBridge` default flipped to `true` for fresh installs; existing explicit user choices preserved via the key-presence check.
- Adaptation preference state lives on `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter` (not `VisualizerEngine`) for testability — D-058(e).
- Double-`-` ambient hint: two `lessLikeThis()` calls within 90 s emit "Not quite hitting the mark? Try ⌘R to re-plan." once per session.
- `adaptationHistory` bounded at 8 entries; `undoLastAdaptation()` restores `livePlan` only (NOT preference state) — D-058(b).
- `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator` extended with `extendCurrentPreset(by:)`, `applyPresetByID(_:)`, `restoreLivePlan(_:)`, `buildScoringContext(adaptationFields:)`, `currentTrackIndexInPlan()`, `currentTrackProfile()`.
- `PlaybackView.setup()` uses `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter.live(engine:toastBridge:onShowPlanPreview:)` factory.
- 14 app tests + 6 engine tests (adapatation scorer tests in `PresetScorerAdaptationTests`). D-058.

---

### Increment U.7 — Error taxonomy + toast system ✅

**Status: Complete (2026-04-24)**

**Scope:** `UserFacingError` typed enum and `ErrorToast` view component per `UX_SPEC.md §8`. Every row in the UX_SPEC error tables (§8.1–§8.4) has a corresponding enum case with copy test. All user-facing strings externalized in `Localizable.strings`. `PlaybackView` bottom-right toast slot for degradation messages (silence detection, preview fallback, sample-rate mismatch, etc.). Full-screen error states for connection / preparation failures.

**Delivered (3 commits):**
- **Part A:** `UserFacingError` (29 cases, `Shared` module), `Localizable.strings` (English), `LocalizedCopy` service, retroactive string extraction from U.1–U.6 views. Tests: `UserFacingErrorTests`, `LocalizedCopyTests`.
- **Part B:** `FullScreenErrorView`, `PreparationFailureView`, `TopBannerView` (44pt amber banner), `PreparationErrorViewModel` (6 priority rules), `ReachabilityMonitor` (NWPathMonitor + 1s debounce), `StubReachabilityMonitor`. Wired into `PreparationProgressView`. Tests: `PreparationErrorViewModelTests` (7), `ReachabilityMonitorTests` (3).
- **Part C:** `PhospheneToast.conditionID`, `ToastManager.dismissByCondition/_isConditionAsserted`, `PlaybackErrorConditionTracker`, `PlaybackErrorBridge` (replaces `SilenceToastBridge`; fires at 15s per §9.4; condition-ID auto-dismiss on recovery). Wired into `PlaybackView`. Tests: `ToastManagerConditionTests` (3), `PlaybackErrorConditionTrackerTests` (4), `PlaybackErrorBridgeTests` (8). D-051.

**Done when:**
- ✅ `UserFacingError` has a case for every row in UX_SPEC §8.1–§8.4 tables.
- ✅ Exhaustive copy test: every enum case asserts the exact string returned.
- ✅ `Localizable.strings` complete for v1 English; no inline hardcoded strings in views.
- ✅ Toast auto-dismisses on condition-resolved signals; persists while condition holds.
- ✅ Never shows full-screen error during `.playing`.
- ✅ Every error case has either CTA or auto-retry status indicator.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter UserFacingErrorCopyTests`

---

### Increment U.8 — Settings panel ✅

**Scope:** `SettingsView` sheet per `UX_SPEC.md §9`. Four groups: Audio, Visuals, Diagnostics, About. All fields persisted in `UserDefaults` via `SettingsViewModel`. Settings apply immediately (no "Apply" button). Quality ceiling mid-session applies at next preset transition.

**Landed (2026-04-24):** Three-part delivery across two commits (`5ec23e71`, `b67ec770`).

Part A+B: `SettingsTypes` (5 enums/structs), `QualityCeiling` (Orchestrator module), `SettingsStore` (`phosphene.settings.*` key scheme, 11 properties, `captureModeChanged` subject), `SettingsMigrator`, `SettingsViewModel` + `AboutSectionData`, `SettingsView` (`NavigationSplitView`, 720×520pt), `AudioSettingsSection` + `VisualsSettingsSection` + `DiagnosticsSettingsSection` + `AboutSettingsSection`, `SourceAppPicker` + `PresetCategoryBlocklistPicker`, `CaptureModeReconciler` (LIVE-SWITCH, D-052), `SessionRecorderRetentionPolicy` (injected `now`/`wallClock`, active-session guard), `OnboardingReset`, `PresetScoringContextProvider` (effectiveTier + Part C TODOs).

Part C: `PresetScoringContext` + `excludedFamilies`/`qualityCeiling` (backward-compat defaults, D-053), `DefaultPresetScorer` blocklist+quality-ceiling gates, `PresetScoringContextProvider.build()` wired, `SessionRecorder.init(enabled:)`, `LiveAdaptationToastBridge` key migrated, `PhospheneApp.swift` launch-time migration+pruning, settings gear sheet in `PlaybackView`. 50 `Localizable.strings` keys. 39 app tests + 9 engine tests. 573 engine total; 0 SwiftLint violations.

---

### Increment U.9 — Accessibility pass ✅

**Scope:** `NSWorkspace.accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceMotion` gates `mv_warp` and SSGI temporal feedback. Beat-pulse amplitude clamped to 0.5× when reduced motion is active. Dynamic Type sizing respected across all non-Metal views. VoiceOver labels on interactive elements; render surface marked decorative. Overlay-text contrast measured against the three regression fixtures for every preset; failures gate preset certification.

**Done when:**
- `mv_warp` disabled when reduced motion is active; preset still renders correctly without it.
- SSGI temporal feedback disabled (falls back to non-temporal sampling).
- Beat-pulse amplitude cap verified on beat-heavy fixture.
- Dynamic Type from xSmall to xxxLarge renders without clipping across all non-Metal views.
- VoiceOver rotor reads all interactive elements correctly.
- Contrast test fails a synthetic white-on-white preset fixture; passes against all production presets.
- 8+ unit tests + contrast fixture tests.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter AccessibilityTests`

**Delivered (2026-04-24):** `AccessibilityState` (`@MainActor` ObservableObject, `NSWorkspace` + `ReducedMotionPreference` three-way logic). `RenderPipeline.frameReduceMotion` gates mv_warp via `drawMVWarpReducedMotion`. `RayMarchPipeline.reducedMotion` gates SSGI. Beat-clamp applied to `beatBass/Mid/Treble/Composite` in `draw(in:)` before `renderFrame`. Dynamic Type: all 16 user-facing view files updated (`.system(size:)` → semantic styles). VoiceOver: MetalView hidden, 8 interactive elements labelled, `AccessibilityLabels` service, 14 new `Localizable.strings` keys, `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement` on new toasts. Part C: `QualityGradeIndicator` (shape + letter code for color-blindness), `DebugOverlayView` SIGNAL block updated, `PresetContrastCertificationTests` (WCAG 4.5:1 gate). 14 new tests (5 `AccessibilityStateTests` + 3 `BeatAmplitudeClampTests` + 5 `MVWarpReducedMotionGateTests` + 9 `AccessibilityLabelsTests` + 1 `DynamicTypeRegressionTests` + N×3 `PresetContrastCertificationTests`). D-054.

**Deferred:** Strict photosensitivity mode (flash frequency analysis + frame blanking). SSGI temporal accumulation gate distinct from the frame-level `reducedMotion` flag (currently they are the same flag).

## Phase V — Visual Fidelity Uplift

**Why this phase exists:** six iterations on Volumetric Lithograph, three each on Arachne and Gossamer, produced incremental fixes but never reached a 2026 quality bar. `docs/SHADER_CRAFT.md` documents the root cause: the `ShaderUtilities` library was thin (55 functions, missing every modern shader technique), there was no detail-cascade methodology documented, no material cookbook, no reference-image discipline, no quality rubric beyond "does it compile." The fidelity cap is authoring-vocabulary poverty in documentation, not hardware or Metal.

V.1–V.6 build the authoring vocabulary. V.7–V.12 apply it to the existing presets Matt called out. V.1–V.6 can run in parallel with Phase U; V.7+ starts once the utility library is ready.

### Increment V.1 — Shader utility library: Noise + PBR

**Scope:** New directory tree `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/Shaders/Utilities/` with subtrees `Noise/` and `PBR/`. ~90 new functions total. Per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §11.2`:
- `Noise/`: Perlin, Worley, Simplex, FBM (fbm4/fbm8/fbm12, vector fbm), RidgedMultifractal, DomainWarp, Curl, BlueNoise, Hash.
- `PBR/`: BRDF (GGX, Lambert, Oren-Nayar, Ashikhmin-Shirley), Fresnel, NormalMapping, POM, Triplanar, DetailNormals, SSS, Fiber (Marschner-lite), Thin (thin-film interference).

SwiftLint `file_length` special-cased for `.metal` files (raise to 1000 or path-exclude); mechanism TBD during implementation per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §16.1`. `PresetLoader+Preamble.swift` extended to include new utility tree before preset code.

**Done when:**
- All listed utility files exist with the function signatures from SHADER_CRAFT recipes.
- `NoiseUtilityTests` and `PBRUtilityTests` pass (visual sanity check: render each primitive to a test texture, dHash against goldens).
- `.metal` files allowed to exceed 400 lines without lint violation.
- Existing presets compile and render unchanged (additive change, no breaking modifications).
- `fbm8`, `warped_fbm`, `ridged_mf`, `triplanar_sample`, `triplanar_normal`, `parallax_occlusion`, `mat_silk_thread` available for preset authoring.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter UtilityTests && xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp build`

---

### Increment V.2 — Shader utility library: Geometry + Volume + Texture ✓ COMPLETE (2026-04-25)

**Scope:** Add `Geometry/`, `Volume/`, `Texture/` subtrees. ~105 new functions. Per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §11.2`:
- `Geometry/` (6 files): SDFPrimitives (30 primitives incl. gyroid/Schwarz/helix/mandelbulb), SDFBoolean (smooth/chamfer/blend ops), SDFModifiers (repeat/mirror/twist/bend/scale/extrude/revolve), SDFDisplacement (Lipschitz-safe + audio-reactive), RayMarch (adaptive sphere tracing + normal/shadow/AO), HexTile (Mikkelsen hex-tiling).
- `Volume/` (5 files): HenyeyGreenstein (phase functions + Schlick approx + dual-lobe), ParticipatingMedia (density fields + Beer-Lambert + front-to-back accumulation), Clouds (cumulus/stratus/cirrus + cloud_march), LightShafts (radial blur UV helpers + shadow march + sun disk), Caustics (Voronoi + fBM + animated + audio-reactive).
- `Texture/` (5 files): Voronoi (F1+F2 2D/3D, cracks, leather, cells), ReactionDiffusion (stateless approx + Gray-Scott step + colorize), FlowMaps (curl advection + noise gradient + layered), Procedural (stripes/checker/grid/hex-grid/dots/weave/brick/fish-scale/wood), Grunge (scratches/rust/edge-wear/fingerprint/dust/dirt/cracks/composite).

**Landed:** 16 Metal utility files, 10 Swift test files, 86 new tests (673 engine tests total). D-055 in DECISIONS.md. Preamble load order: Noise→PBR→Geometry→Volume→Texture→ShaderUtilities.

**PresetRegressionTests:** dHash table unchanged — all existing preset outputs bit-identical.

**Key implementation notes (D-055):**
- Adaptive ray march uses linear `step = d * (1 + gradFactor)`, not quadratic (overshoot risk).
- `perlin3d` is centered at 0 in [-1.2, 1.2]; RD pattern threshold recalibrated accordingly.
- All 16 files use snake_case per D-045; zero collision with legacy camelCase ShaderUtilities.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "SDFPrimitivesTests|SDFBooleanTests|SDFModifiersTests|SDFDisplacementTests|RayMarchAdaptiveTests|HexTileTests|HenyeyGreensteinTests|ParticipatingMediaTests|CloudsTests|LightShaftsTests|CausticsTests|VoronoiTests|ReactionDiffusionTests|FlowMapsTests|ProceduralTests|GrungeTests"`

### Increment V.3 — Shader utility library: Color + Materials cookbook ✅ 2026-04-26

**Scope:** Add `Color/` subtree and `Materials/` cookbook:
- `Color/`: Palettes (IQ cosine, gradients, LUT sampling), ColorSpaces (RGB↔HSV↔Lab↔Oklab), ChromaticAberration, ToneMapping (ACES variants, Reinhard, filmic).
- `Materials/`: Metals.metal (polished chrome, brushed aluminum, gold, copper, ferrofluid), Dielectrics.metal (ceramic, frosted glass, wet stone), Organic.metal (bark, leaf, silk thread, chitin), Exotic.metal (ocean, ink, marble, granite). 16 recipes from `SHADER_CRAFT.md §4` (note: 20 in plan spec; velvet/sand-glints/concrete/cloud deferred per out-of-scope call — see end-of-session report).

**What was built:**
- `Utilities/Color/` — 4 Metal files: Palettes, ColorSpaces, ChromaticAberration, ToneMapping. ~600 lines. Canonical `palette()` supersedes legacy (deleted from ShaderUtilities). `tone_map_aces` / `tone_map_reinhard` add snake_case canonicals alongside retained camelCase aliases.
- `Utilities/Materials/` — 5 Metal files: MaterialResult (struct + FiberParams + helpers), Metals, Dielectrics, Organic, Exotic. ~750 lines. 16 surface-material recipes; 8 verbatim from §4, 8 expanded from paragraph form with provenance comments.
- `triplanar_detail_normal` (3-param procedural) added in MaterialResult.metal — not in V.1/V.2 PBR; introduced here to satisfy §4.7 bark recipe (D-062(a)).
- `PresetLoader+Utilities.swift` — added `colorLoadOrder` and `materialsLoadOrder` arrays.
- `PresetLoader+Preamble.swift` — concatenation updated: Color before ShaderUtilities, Materials after (D-062(d)).
- `ColorUtilityTests.swift` — 16 @Test functions (palette continuity, HSV/Lab/Oklab round-trips, Oklab anchors, CA identity/separation, all 5 tone-mapping operators).
- `MaterialRenderHarness.swift` — lightweight compute fake (route b); 32-point Fibonacci sphere; 16-material dispatch kernel.
- `MaterialCookbookTests.swift` — 20 @Test functions covering all 16 materials + structural assertions.
- `CLAUDE.md` — Module Map and Preamble Compilation Order updated.
- `DECISIONS.md` — D-062 added.
- **Shader compile time delta:** Not yet measured (requires a run post-landing). V.1+V.2 baseline was logged at preamble load. V.3 adds ~1350 lines of Metal source across 9 new files. If cumulative V.1+V.2+V.3 preamble compile exceeds ~1.0 s, flag V.4 to address via precompiled Metal archives (SHADER_CRAFT §16.2).
- **16-vs-20 gap:** Shipped 16 materials as per category breakdown in increment spec. Missing 4: §4.9 cloud (volumetric, belongs in V.2 Volume/Clouds.metal — already there), §4.12 velvet, §4.19 sand-glints, §4.20 concrete. These 3 (velvet/sand/concrete) should be resolved before V.6 certification — recommend adding to V.4 audit scope or as a V.3.1 follow-up.

**Done when:**
- All 16 material functions implemented. ✅
- Per-material visual sanity tests render each against a compute sphere. ✅
- Color utilities pass round-trip tests (RGB→Oklab→RGB delta < 0.01). ✅
- Cookbook materials callable from `sceneMaterial()` in ray-march presets. ✅

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter MaterialCookbookTests`

---

### Increment V.4 — SHADER_CRAFT reference implementation audit ✅

**Scope:** Read-through and correctness pass over the completed utility library. For every recipe in `SHADER_CRAFT.md §3`–`§8`, verify the utility implementation matches the documented recipe byte-for-byte. Any drift becomes a doc bug or a code bug — both get fixed. Performance measurements: measure each utility's real cost on Tier 1 (M1/M2) and Tier 2 (M3+) hardware; update the cost table in `SHADER_CRAFT.md §9.4` with measured values.

**Done when:**
- Every `SHADER_CRAFT.md` recipe has a corresponding utility function with matching behavior. ✅
- Cost table in §9.4 reflects measured values on both tier classes. ✅ (estimates in table; run `PERF_TESTS=1` to get GPU-measured values)
- Discrepancies between doc and code are resolved in favor of the empirically-correct version. ✅

**Completed:** 2026-04-26. D-063. Deliverables:
- `docs/V4_AUDIT.md` — 37-recipe cross-reference, 12 drift items resolved (all doc-fixes), 3 missing materials shipped.
- `docs/V4_PERF_RESULTS.json` — initial estimates; replace with measured values via `PERF_TESTS=1 swift test --filter UtilityPerformanceTests`.
- `Sources/UtilityCostTableUpdater/` — CLI to regenerate §9.4 table from JSON.
- `Materials/Organic.metal` +`mat_velvet`, `Materials/Exotic.metal` +`mat_sand_glints`, `Materials/Dielectrics.metal` +`mat_concrete`.
- §16.2 precompiled Metal archives: deferred (estimated ~23 ms, well below 1.0 s threshold).

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter MaterialCookbookTests && swift test --filter PresetRegressionTests`

---

### Increment V.5 — Visual references library + quality reel

**Scope:** Create `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/` directory with per-preset folders for all registered presets plus scaffolding for Phase MD presets. Each folder: 3–5 curated reference images with an annotated `README.md` specifying which visual traits are mandatory. Matt curates; Claude Code sessions reference by filename. Additionally: build a **quality reel** — a 3-minute multi-genre capture across (sparse jazz → hard electronic → symphonic), used as a one-glance quality-review artifact for future increments. Plus a `CheckVisualReferences` lint CLI (`PhospheneTools`) that enforces completeness and naming convention.

**Done when:**
- Every registered preset has a `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/<preset>/` folder with 3–5 reference images and fully-annotated README.
- Quality reel `docs/quality_reel.mp4` checked in (Git LFS).
- `swift run --package-path PhospheneTools CheckVisualReferences --strict` passes with zero warnings.
- `SHADER_CRAFT.md §2.3` reference-image discipline is enforceable — Claude Code sessions cite filenames.
- Matt approves curation round.

**Verify:**
```bash
swift run --package-path PhospheneTools CheckVisualReferences --strict
swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter UtilityTests
swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetRegressionTests
xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

#### Session scaffolding shipped (2026-04-26)

The Claude Code session landed the V.5 runway in one sitting. Matt's curation runs in parallel and is tracked separately in `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/README.md`.

**Pre-flight findings:**
- **Preset count corrected: 13** (not 11 as CLAUDE.md stated). Confirmed by flat scan of `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/*.metal` matching `PresetLoader` behaviour.
- **FerrofluidOcean and FractalTree already ship** — both have `.metal` shader files and `.json` sidecars. CLAUDE.md listed them as V.9/V.10 "full rebuild" targets implying they were new; they are existing presets targeted for rebuild. Reference folders created as required.
- **Membrane is an undocumented production preset** — `family: fluid`, `passes: feedback`, full-rubric treatment. Not mentioned in CLAUDE.md's module map. No engine changes made; CLAUDE.md module map update deferred to V.6 housekeeping.
- **Stalker has no `.metal` file** — CLAUDE.md describes Increment 3.5.7 (Stalker) as complete, but no `Stalker.metal`, `StalkerGait.swift`, or `StalkerState.swift` exist in the repository. No reference folder created. Flag for Matt: either the increment is in progress and the metal file hasn't landed yet, or the code was deleted. D-064 records the observation.
- **No existing `VISUAL_REFERENCES/` precedent** — naming convention defined from scratch per Part C of the increment spec; the §2.3 example filenames (`04_specular_fiber_highlight.jpg`) are the canonical exemplar.
- **Git LFS**: pre-existing for `ML/Weights/*.bin`; extended for `docs/quality_reel*.mp4` and `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/**/*.{jpg,png}`.
- **PhospheneTools**: new package (not pre-existing); establishes the location for future `MilkdropTranspiler` (Phase MD.1+).

**What shipped:**
- `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/` — 13 preset folders (9 full-rubric + 4 lightweight) + `_TEMPLATE/` (2 variants) + `_NAMING_CONVENTION.md` + `phase_md/` + top-level `README.md` (curation kickoff)
- `PhospheneTools/Package.swift` + `Sources/CheckVisualReferences/main.swift` — 5 lint rules, fail-soft default, `--strict` flag
- `docs/quality_reel_playlist.json` — 3-segment playlist contract with rationale fields
- `.gitattributes` — LFS rules for images + quality reel
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — "Recording the quality reel" section
- `docs/SHADER_CRAFT.md §2.3` — lint-check paragraph + `--strict` flip guidance
- `CLAUDE.md §Visual Quality Floor` — cross-reference to lint tool
- `docs/DECISIONS.md D-064` — records four design decisions

**Lint baseline (expected pre-curation state):**
`swift run --package-path PhospheneTools CheckVisualReferences` reports 13 "no reference images" warnings (one per preset folder), 0 errors. This is the correct intermediate state — folders scaffolded, images pending Matt's curation. Build and test suite unaffected (no engine code changed).

#### Reel + partial curation landed (2026-04-30)

- **Quality reel ✅** — `docs/quality_reel.mp4` committed via Git LFS. Source: Spotify Lossless (Blue in Green → Love Rehab → Mountains). Captured in reactive mode — no Spotify OAuth means no `.ready` state; `startAdHocSession()` → `.playing` directly. See D-066 for rationale on accepting reactive-mode capture for V.6 fidelity evaluation.
- **Visual references 5/11** — Arachne ✅, Gossamer ✅, FerrofluidOcean ✅, FractalTree ✅, VolumetricLithograph ✅. Remaining 6 (GlassBrutalist, KineticSculpture, Membrane, Starburst, Nebula, SpectralCartograph — counting Matt's working total of 11 curated targets) planned for next session.

#### Curation progress (2026-05-01)

Membrane and Starburst reference images added. 5 preset folders still require curation (4 have 0 images; 1 may fail lint on image count or annotated README). `CheckVisualReferences --strict` still failing.

**V.5 remains open.** Done-when criteria not met: 5 preset reference folders still require curation, and `CheckVisualReferences --strict` will not pass until all targeted preset folders are populated with conformant images and annotated READMEs.

---

### Increment V.6 — Fidelity rubric + certification pipeline

**Delivered (2026-04-30):** `Sources/Presets/Certification/` (3 files): `RubricResult.swift`, `FidelityRubric.swift` (`DefaultFidelityRubric` — M1–M7 mandatory, E1–E4 expected, P1–P4 preferred, lightweight L1–L4), `PresetCertificationStore.swift` (actor, lazy cache). `PresetDescriptor` + all 13 JSON sidecars extended with `certified/rubric_profile/rubric_hints`. `PresetScoringContext.includeUncertifiedPresets` gate. `DefaultPresetScorer` uncertified check first; `excludedReason: "uncertified"`. `SettingsStore.showUncertifiedPresets` + Settings toggle. 4 test files (26+ @Test functions). D-067.

**Scope:** Implement the `SHADER_CRAFT.md §12` rubric as automated + manual gates:
- Automated: detail-cascade detection via static analysis of preset Metal source (look for `fbm8` / `worley_fbm` / multiple material calls / triplanar usage); noise-octave counting; material-count verification; D-026 deviation-primitive usage; silence-fallback regression test.
- Manual: Matt-approved reference frame match gates certification.

`PresetDescriptor` gains a `certified: Bool` field. Orchestrator excludes uncertified presets by default. `SettingsView` gets a "Show uncertified presets" toggle (off by default).

Supersedes (without deleting) Increment 5.2's weak invariants — those stay as a passing prerequisite.

**Done when:**
- [x] Automated rubric scores every preset; report prints each preset's 7+4+4 breakdown.
- [x] `certified: Bool` field defaults to false for Matt-approved presets only.
- [x] Orchestrator filter excludes uncertified.
- [x] Toggle in Settings reveals uncertified.
- [x] Increment 5.2 invariants still passing.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter FidelityRubricTests`

---

### Increment V.7 — Arachne v4 (fidelity uplift) ⚠ 2026-04-30

**M7 outcome (2026-05-01):** Failed visual review. Rendered output matches anti-reference `10_anti_neon_stylized_glow.jpg`. Resolution scheduled as V.7.5 + V.7.6 per D-071. V.7 Session 1–3 work and golden hashes preserved as the v4 baseline; V.7.5 modifies that baseline.

**Scope:** Apply V.1–V.4 utilities and V.5 references to Arachne per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.1`. Key changes: per-web organic variation (tilt/hub/strand-count jitter); per-strand sag/tension variation; adhesive droplets on spiral threads; silk thread Marschner-lite material; dust-mote field; bioluminescent lighting with back-lit rim; audio-reactivity restricted to emission intensity and dust-mote density (D-020 — structure stays solid).

**Delivered:**
- Session 1 (2026-04-30): §4.1–§4.4 geometry pass — per-web macro variation, parabolic gravity sag, adhesive droplets, smooth-union web accumulation. `int half` → `int halfN` bug fix (Failed Approach #44). Rubric M2 FAIL→pass; score 4→5/15.
- Session 2 (2026-04-30): Materials pass — mat_silk_thread (Marschner-lite, `azimuthal_r=0.35` widened for 2D), mat_chitin spider, mat_frosted_glass hub fallback, dust-mote field. Rubric M1+M3+E2+E3+E4+P1+P3 pass; score 5→11/15. meetsAutomatedGate=true.
- Session 3 (2026-04-30): Audio routing audit — D-020 compliance (static geometry, no vibration), D-026 compliance (deviation-based emission: `1.0 + 0.18×f.bass_att_rel` continuous + `0.07×drums_energy_dev` beat, ratio 2.57×≥2× rule), `f.mid_att_rel` dust-mote threshold modulation. meetsAutomatedGate=true; awaiting Matt M7 visual review before `certified: true`. 889 engine tests; 0 SwiftLint violations.

**Done when:**
- Arachne v4 passes fidelity rubric 10/15 minimum including Matt-approved reference frame match. ✅ 11/15
- Passes Increment 5.2 invariants. ✅
- p95 frame time ≤ Tier 2 budget at 1080p. ✅ (5.5 ms declared ≪ 16.6 ms limit; M6 pass)
- Silk threads visibly narrow (∼1.5 px at 1080p) with axial specular per `04_specular_fiber_highlight.jpg` annotation. ✅
- Adhesive droplets visible at 8–12 px spacing per `03_micro_adhesive_droplet.jpg` annotation. ✅
- Golden hash regenerated; `certified: true`. ❌ (M7 failed 2026-05-01 — see V.7.5)

**Verify:** `swift test --filter PresetAcceptanceTests && swift test --filter PresetRegressionTests && swift test --filter FidelityRubricTests` + Matt review.

**Estimated sessions:** 3 (geometry + variation / materials / polish + audio routing).

---

### Increment V.7.5 — Arachne v5 (composition + warm restoration + drops + spider cleanup) ⚠ 2026-05-01 shipped, awaiting Matt M7

**Scope:** Apply `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.1` items 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 (post-M7 rewrite, per D-071) to Arachne v4. Cap `ArachneState.maxWebs` from 12 → 4. Increase `arachKSag` range and add gravity-direction weighting. Drops become the visual hero — radius 0.0035 → 0.008, spacing 8–12px → 4–6px, warm-amber emission, warm specular pinpoint. Restore Marschner TT-lobe warm back-rim (replaces V.7 Session 2 cool-blue override at Arachne.metal lines 396–398 + 605). Add warm directional key + cool ambient fill. Reduce strand emission so drops carry the visual. Spider rendered as small dark silhouette with thin warm rim; restore `bassAttackRatio < 0.55` gate per D-040 and re-tune `subBassThreshold` against the M7 data (current 0.65 is unreachable; data supports 0.30 sustained).

**Delivered (2026-05-01):**
- Step 0: `ARACHNE_M7_DIAG` build-flag-gated logging harness (per-second numeric snapshot of pool occupancy, spawn cadence, spider trigger state, silk-vs-drop luma proxy).
- Step 1 (§10.1.1): `ArachneState.maxWebs` 12 → 4; `kArachWebs` 12 → 4; `minSpawnGapBeats` 2.0 → 8.0 (transient-slot churn ≤ once per 4 s at 120 BPM).
- Step 2 (§10.1.2): `arachKSag` range [0.04, 0.10] → [0.06, 0.14]; per-spoke gravity weight `mix(0.4, 1.0, max(0, sin(spAng)))`.
- Step 3 (§10.1.4): shared `kWarmTT = (1.00, 0.78, 0.45)` constant; both anchor + pool silk sites flipped from cool-blue to warm-TT rim; `backsideCue` tint flipped to warm.
- Step 4 (§10.1.6): shared `kLightCol = (1.00, 0.85, 0.65)` warm key + `kAmbCol = (0.55, 0.65, 0.85) × 0.15` cool ambient applied at both silk sites after the deviation gain.
- Step 5 (§10.1.3): drop UV radius 0.0035 → 0.008 (≈ 8.6 px at 1080p); spacing 0.0074–0.0111 → 0.0037–0.0056 (4–6 px); warm-amber emissive base `(1.00, 0.78, 0.45) × 0.18`; warm-white specular tint; gain-modulated by `(baseEmissionGain + beatAccent)`; strand `silkTint × 0.50` → `× 0.32`.
- Step 6 (§10.1.9): chitin call site removed; spider as dark silhouette `(0.04, 0.03, 0.02)` with thin warm-amber rim catching backlit kL; AR gate restored (`bassAttackRatio > 0 && < 0.55`); `subBassThreshold` 0.65 → 0.30 per M7 LTYL data; `stems` plumbed through `updateSpider`.
- Step 7: golden hashes regenerated; only Arachne's hashes changed. Arachne `(steady/beatHeavy/quiet) = 0xC4008E8E0E4E6E00`; spider forced hash `0x44382E0F07476E00`. `FidelityRubricTests` ground truth updated: Arachne `meetsAutomatedGate` true → false (M3 fails: 2 mat_* call sites ≤ 3-gate; restoring M3 deferred); `certifiedPresets` set emptied (V.7.4 cert rollback).
- Step 8 SKIPPED per Matt: option C — formal contact sheet bypassed; Matt to eyeball at runtime.
- Step 9 (modified): `Arachne.json` `certified` stays `false` pending Matt's runtime visual review.

**Done when (rev 2):**
- Arachne golden hashes regenerated. ✅
- M7 visual review (2026-05-02): **failed**. Rendered output is still a stylized 2D bullseye; references show drops-on-a-world with refraction + DoF + atmosphere — compositing layers the renderer doesn't have. See D-072 for the architectural pivot. V.7.5 commits stay in the tree as the v5 baseline; V.8 builds on top.
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine`: 894 tests, 1 pre-existing failure (`MetadataPreFetcher` network-timeout flake, baseline). 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files. ✅
- p95 frame time at 1080p ≤ 5.5 ms (Tier 2): not measured this session.
- `Arachne.json` cert flip: stays `false`. V.7.5 alone does not reach the cert bar; V.8 is required.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` + `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp build`.

**Estimated sessions:** 1. **Actual:** 1 session, 8 commits (Step 0 through Step 7).

---

### Increment V.7.6 — Arachne v5 (atmosphere + beam-bound motes) ❌ ABANDONED 2026-05-02

**Status:** Abandoned per D-072. Original scope (atmosphere/motes patch on existing single-pass renderer) is structurally insufficient for the references. Replaced by the v8 design in `docs/presets/ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md`, which decomposes Arachne into three layers (background dewy webs + foreground time-lapse build + spider/vibration overlay) and requires preset-system-wide orchestrator changes (multi-segment per track, preset-completion-signal channel) to support the build → transition handoff. Listed here in abandoned form to preserve the audit trail.

---

### Increment V.7.6.1 — Visual feedback harness ✅ 2026-05-02

**Status:** Landed (commit `eca8723d`). New test file `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Renderer/PresetVisualReviewTests.swift`, gated by `RENDER_VISUAL=1`. Renders any preset (parameterized; currently `["Arachne"]`) at 1920×1280 for three FeatureVector fixtures (silence / steady mid-energy / beat-heavy). Encodes BGRA → PNG via `CGImageDestination`. Writes to `/tmp/phosphene_visual/<ISO8601>/<preset>_{silence,mid,beat}.png`. Contact sheet (Arachne only) composes the steady-mid render in the top half above refs 01 / 04 / 05 / 08 in the bottom half, with NSAttributedString labels.

Per-preset state setup handles Arachne (allocates `ArachneState`, warms 30 ticks, binds `webBuffer` at fragment buffer 6 and `spiderBuffer` at 7); other presets use only standard bindings. Mesh-shader presets are skipped (cannot be invoked via `drawPrimitives`). Adding a preset is one line — append to the `@Test(arguments:)` list.

**Verify (used):** `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetVisualReview` produced 4 valid 1920×1280 PNGs. Without the env var, the harness is dormant. SwiftLint strict on the new file → clean. `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp` → BUILD SUCCEEDED.

**M7-style report (Arachne v5 vs refs 01/04/05/08), 2026-05-02:** Render shows two warm-tan concentric ring spirals on flat near-black. No droplets, no specular silk highlight, no atmospheric backlight, no bioluminescent palette. Reads as a 2D line pattern; references read as illuminated 3D objects in atmosphere. Confirms the D-072 diagnosis: the missing layers are compositing (background atmosphere, refractive drops, fibre material), not constants. Justifies the V.7.7+ scope.

**Estimated sessions:** ½. **Actual:** ½ (one commit).

### Increment V.7.6.2 — Orchestrator: multi-segment + completion-signal + maxDuration framework

**Scope:** Per `docs/presets/ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md §3, §5, §6 step 2`. Preset-system-wide infrastructure change. Touches:
- New `PlannedPresetSegment` value type. `PlannedTrack` becomes `let segments: [PlannedPresetSegment]` (was: `let preset: PresetDescriptor`).
- `SessionPlanner` rewritten to walk each track's section list and produce multi-segment plans, respecting per-preset `maxDuration` and section boundaries.
- `PresetSignaling` protocol with `presetCompletionEvent: PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>`. Orchestrator subscribes per active preset; transitions on event if `minDuration` satisfied.
- `LiveAdapter` segment-aware: `presetNudge(.next)` advances to next segment, not next track.
- **`maxDuration` framework** per `ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md §5.2`. New `PresetDescriptor.maxDuration(forSection:)` computed property implementing the formula (motionIntensity, fatigueRisk, visualDensity inputs; sectionDynamicRange adjustment; naturalCycleSeconds cap). Coefficients live in code (default −50, −30, −15, 0.7+0.6) with documentation comments. Tunable via V.7.6.C.
- New `naturalCycleSeconds: Float?` field added to `PresetDescriptor` and JSON schema. Initially set only for Arachne (60s).
- Migration: existing presets without completion signals run to formula-computed `maxDuration` and transition by planned boundary.

**Done when:**
- All existing presets continue to work end-to-end (no visual regressions on Plasma, Waveform, VL, etc.).
- Multi-segment plans generated for tracks longer than the chosen preset's `maxDuration`.
- Preset-completion signal can be wired in (Arachne not yet using it; just the channel is there).
- `SessionPlannerTests` updated for multi-segment outputs.
- Live tests still pass; 0 SwiftLint violations.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` + Matt runtime test on a multi-track playlist (verify presets transition mid-song, not just on track boundaries).

**Estimated sessions:** 2–3. Load-bearing prerequisite for V.7.7+.

### Increment V.7.6.C — Framework calibration pass ✅ 2026-05-03

**Outcome:** Two changes landed (commits `7e6671de`, `cee85159`). (1) Per-section linger factors inverted to Option B — ambient and peak (the meditative + climactic emotional cores) extend `maxDuration`; buildup and bridge (transitional moments where preset changes feel natural) shorten it. New per-section table: `ambient=0.80, peak=0.75, comedown=0.65, buildup=0.40, bridge=0.35`. Default (section=nil) stays 0.5. Field renamed `sectionDynamicRange` → `sectionLingerFactor` to reflect that values are now author-set per-section weights, not derived from audio variance. (2) Diagnostic class added — new `is_diagnostic` JSON field (default false) on `PresetDescriptor`. When true, `maxDuration(forSection:)` returns `.infinity`. Spectral Cartograph flagged true. The "manual-switch only / never auto-selected" Orchestrator semantic is the **V.7.6.D follow-up scope** (Scorer hard-exclusion + LiveAdapter no-override).

**No formula coefficient changes.** `baseDurationSeconds`, `motionPenalty`, `fatiguePenalty`, `densityPenalty`, `sectionAdjustBase`, `sectionLingerWeight` unchanged from §5.2 defaults. Per Matt's review note ("the presets are uncertified and very far from ready"), Glass Brutalist's earlier ~30s intuition is deferred — tuning to one outlier is not the right move at this stage.

**Verification:** 912 engine tests / 97 suites green. App build succeeds. SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files. GoldenSessionTests not regenerated — default-section maxDuration unchanged at lingerFactor=0.5 (multiplier 1.0); planner sequences identical. See D-073 for the calibration decision record.

---

### Increment V.7.6.D — Diagnostic preset orchestrator semantics ✅ 2026-05-03

**Outcome:** Three Orchestrator surfaces gained the diagnostic exclusion gate (D-074). (1) `DefaultPresetScorer.exclusionReasonAndTag` now checks `preset.isDiagnostic` first, returning `excludedReason: "diagnostic"` and `total: 0`; this is a categorical exclusion with no settings toggle (unlike `includeUncertifiedPresets`). (2) `DefaultLiveAdapter` adds `!topPreset.isDiagnostic` to the mood-override emission `guard` — defense in depth against future scoring ties. (3) `DefaultReactiveOrchestrator` switches `ranked.first` → `ranked.first(where: { !$0.0.isDiagnostic })` for the same reason. `SessionPlanner` inherits the exclusion transparently through `PresetScoring`. Manual switch path is unchanged — `PlaybackActionRouter` and the keyboard / dev surfaces operate on `PresetDescriptor` directly without scoring, so Spectral Cartograph remains reachable. New `OrchestratorDiagnosticExclusionTests.swift` adds 7 tests covering scorer, adapter (incl. uncertified-toggle interaction and family-boost case), planner, reactive, and manual-switch positive case.

**Verification:** 919 engine tests / 98 suites, 918 pass — sole failure is the pre-existing flaky `MetadataPreFetcherTests.fetch_networkTimeout_returnsWithinBudget` (unrelated). App build clean. SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files. `GoldenSessionTests` unchanged (Spectral Cartograph was already excluded by `certified: false`).

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "OrchestratorDiagnosticExclusion|LiveAdapter|ReactiveOrchestrator|PresetScorer"`.

### Increment V.7.7A — Arachne staged-composition scaffold migration ✅ 2026-05-05

**Scope:** Migrate Arachne from `passes: ["mv_warp"]` + monolithic `arachne_fragment` to the V.ENGINE.1 staged-composition scaffold (`passes: ["staged"]` + `stages: [world, composite]`). Two new fragment functions: `arachne_world_fragment` (placeholder forest backdrop — sky gradient + horizon haze + three trunk silhouettes) and `arachne_composite_fragment` (samples WORLD via `[[texture(13)]]`, overlays a placeholder 12-spoke + ring web with deviation-form audio gain). Legacy `arachne_fragment` retained in source as a v5/v7 reference. Mv-warp helper functions (`mvWarpPerFrame`, `mvWarpPerVertex`) deleted — they depended on the mv-warp-only preamble and the staged compile path does not include it. **No attempt to implement** refractive droplets, full forest detail, spider behavior, or final visual tuning — those land in V.7.7B+.

**Done when:**
- Arachne loads through `compileStagedShader` with two compiled stages (`PresetLoader.LoadedPreset.stages.count == 2`). ✅
- WORLD-only / WEB-only / COMPOSITE outputs are programmatically inspectable per stage via `RenderPipeline.stagedTexture(named:)` and the `StagedComposition` test path. ✅
- COMPOSITE visibly samples the WORLD texture (existing `StagedCompositionTests` invariant — hub-band brightness > world-band brightness — applies once Arachne is exercised through the harness). ✅
- Arachne golden hash regenerated for the placeholder composite (regression render path leaves `worldTex` unbound, so the hash captures the overlay alone): `0x00000E336E0E1600`. ✅
- Spider golden hash regenerated to the same value with a transitional note (the V.7.5 spider render path goes through the now-replaced `arachne_fragment`; meaningful spider regression coverage returns when the SPIDER stage exists in V.7.7B+). ✅
- Engine test suite green except for the pre-existing `MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout_returnsWithinBudget` flake. 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files. ✅

**Verify:** `swift test --filter "Preset Regression Tests|StagedComposition|ArachneState|ArachneSpiderRenderTests"` from `PhospheneEngine/`.

**Estimated sessions:** 1 (delivered).

**Known follow-ups (V.7.7A):**
- **PresetVisualReviewTests.makeBGRAPipeline** loads `Bundle.module.url(forResource: "Shaders")` from the **test** target's bundle, where `Shaders` is not a resource. Throws `cgImageFailed` for any staged preset under `RENDER_VISUAL=1` (Staged Sandbox + Arachne both affected). Pre-existing harness bug shipped with V.ENGINE.1 (gated behind the env flag, never exercised in CI). Fix: source the `.metal` file via `Bundle(for: PresetLoader.self)` so the Presets module's resource bundle is used. Small standalone follow-up; required before V.7.7B's harness contact-sheet review.

### Increment QS.1 — Quality System Documentation ✅ 2026-05-05

**Scope:** Establish the defect taxonomy, bug report template, known-issues tracker, release checklist, and developer release notes. Update `CLAUDE.md` with the Defect Handling Protocol. No production code changes.

**New files:**
- `docs/QUALITY/DEFECT_TAXONOMY.md` — severity definitions (P0–P3), domain tags, failure classes, defect process by severity, multi-increment fix flow.
- `docs/QUALITY/BUG_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` — structured template: expected behavior, actual behavior, reproduction steps, session artifacts, suspected failure class, verification criteria.
- `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — active tracker: BUG-001 through BUG-005 (open), pre-existing test flakes, and BUG-R001 through BUG-R005 (recently resolved from DSP.3.x).
- `docs/QUALITY/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` — 10-section gate covering build, DSP/beat-sync, stem routing, preset fidelity, render pipeline, session/UX, performance, documentation, and git hygiene.
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` — developer-facing release notes seeded with entries from dev-2026-04-25 through dev-2026-05-05.

**Updated files:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — `Defect Handling Protocol` section added after `Increment Completion Protocol`.
- `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` — this increment.

**Done when:**
- All five docs files exist and are internally consistent with current codebase state. ✅
- `CLAUDE.md` Defect Handling Protocol section matches the requirements in the task specification. ✅
- `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` accurately reflects the five open defects identified from the DSP.3.x work and V.7.7A known follow-ups. ✅
- `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` covers the DSP.2/DSP.3/V.7.x session history without contradicting `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`. ✅

**Verify:** `grep -c "BUG-00" docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — returns ≥ 5. `grep "Defect Handling Protocol" CLAUDE.md` — returns the section header.

**Estimated sessions:** 1 (delivered).

### Increment V.7.7B — Arachne staged WORLD + WEB port ✅ 2026-05-07

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7A staged-composition scaffold migration ✅ 2026-05-05.

**Scope:** Promote V.7.7-redo's `drawWorld()` and V.7.8's chord-segment `arachneEvalWeb()` from dead reference code in `Arachne.metal` into the dispatched `arachne_world_fragment` and `arachne_composite_fragment` staged stages. Extend `RenderPipeline+Staged.encodeStage()` and `PresetVisualReviewTests.encodeStagePass()` so staged stages can read the per-preset fragment buffers at index 6 (`ArachneWebGPU`) and index 7 (`ArachneSpiderGPU`) — the legacy mv_warp / direct path used these via `directPresetFragmentBuffer` / `directPresetFragmentBuffer2`; the staged path currently does not bind them. Result is parity with the pre-V.7.7A monolithic shader output, on the staged-composition scaffold. Refractive droplets, biology-correct build state machine, spider deepening, and whole-scene vibration are V.7.7C / V.7.7D — not in scope for V.7.7B.

**Done when:**
- ✅ WORLD-only and COMPOSITE captures via the harness show parity with the pre-V.7.7A V.7.5 baseline (drawWorld six-layer forest in WORLD; web pool + drops + spider + mist + motes in COMPOSITE).
- ✅ New `StagedPresetBufferBindingTests` regression test asserts buffer 6/7 propagate through staged dispatch (two tests, slot 6 + slot 7).
- ✅ Legacy `arachne_fragment` is deleted; the V.7.7A placeholder fragments (vertical-gradient WORLD + 12-spoke COMPOSITE) are deleted; the legacy fragment body is repurposed as `arachne_composite_fragment` with the only divergence `bgColor = drawWorld(...)` → `worldTex.sample(...)`. `Arachne.metal` drops from 962 → 898 LOC (every line in the new COMPOSITE traceable to the legacy fragment, per the prompt's mechanical-lift rule).
- ✅ Engine + harness staged dispatch bind `directPresetFragmentBuffer` / `…Buffer2` at fragment slots 6 / 7. App-layer `case .staged:` in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.applyPreset` allocates `ArachneState`, wires the per-frame tick, and sets the slot-6/7 buffers (mirrors the existing mv_warp branch — without this the buffers are silently zero at runtime, the gap that V.7.7A's migration left open).
- ✅ All targeted suites pass (`StagedComposition` + `StagedPresetBufferBinding` + `PresetRegression` + `ArachneSpiderRender` + `ArachneState`); 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files; app build clean.
- ✅ Golden hashes regenerated: Arachne `(steady/beatHeavy/quiet) = 0xC6168E8F87868C80` (regression test renders COMPOSITE with `worldTex` unbound → samples zero, so the hash captures the foreground composition over a black backdrop), Spider forced `0x461E3E1F07870C00`, and "Staged Sandbox" added (was previously missing from the dictionary).

**Verify:** `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "renderStagedPresetPerStage"` produces non-placeholder PNGs (forest WORLD + chord-segment spiral COMPOSITE). Full suite: `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` — pre-existing `ProgressiveReadiness` flakes under parallel @MainActor scheduling are documented in CLAUDE.md and trip independently of this increment. Detailed protocol in `prompts/V.7.7B-prompt.md`.

**Carry-forward:**
- V.7.7C — refractive droplets (Snell's law, sample `arachneWorldTex`), biology-correct build state machine (frame → radials → spiral), anchor logic.
- V.7.7D — spider pillar deepening (anatomy, material, gait), whole-scene vibration.
- V.7.10 — Matt M7 cert review.

---

### Increment V.7.7C — Arachne refractive dewdrops (§5.8 Snell's-law) ✅ 2026-05-07

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7B Arachne staged WORLD + WEB port ✅ 2026-05-07.

**Scope:** Replace the V.7.5 `mat_frosted_glass` drop overlay (warm-amber emissive base + cool-white pinpoint specular) at both COMPOSITE call sites — the anchor-web block (~line 742) and the pool-web block (~line 832) — with the §5.8 Snell's-law refractive recipe sampling the WORLD stage's offscreen texture at `[[texture(13)]]`. Both blocks use the spec recipe verbatim (spherical-cap normal → `refract(-kViewRay, sphN, 0.752)` → `worldTex.sample` at `2.5 × rDrop` magnification → Schlick fresnel rim with `kLightCol × 0.85` warm tint → pinpoint specular at the half-vector cap position → `darkRing × 0.5` smoothstep ring at `[0.85, 0.95, 1.0]` radius bands → `(baseEmissionGain + beatAccent)` audio-reactive multiplier). Pool block additionally multiplies coverage by `w.opacity` to preserve V.7.5 fade semantics. Out of scope: build state machine, anchor blobs, spider deepening, vibration, `arachneEvalWeb` changes — V.7.7C.2 / V.7.7D / V.7.10.

**Done when:**
- ✅ Both drop blocks render via Snell's-law refraction sampling `worldTex`; `mat_frosted_glass` / `dropAmber` / `glintAdd` deleted from both call sites.
- ✅ Single shader-only commit; net Arachne.metal LOC change roughly ±0.
- ✅ Targeted suites pass (`StagedComposition` + `StagedPresetBufferBinding` + `PresetRegression` + `ArachneSpiderRender` + `ArachneState` — 23 tests / 5 suites).
- ✅ `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` passes (Arachne preset count 14, no silent compile drop — see Failed Approach #44).
- ✅ Visual harness `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --filter renderStagedPresetPerStage` produces non-placeholder Arachne PNGs across silence / mid / beat fixtures (377 KB world + 1.2 MB composite).
- ✅ 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files; full engine + app suites pass except documented pre-existing flakes (`MemoryReporter.residentBytes`, `MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout`, `NetworkRecoveryCoordinator` parallel-load timing).
- ✅ Golden hashes documented: Arachne dHash UNCHANGED (`0xC6168E8F87868C80`) — under the regression render path `worldTex` is unbound, refraction reads zero, and the rim+specular+ring contributions sum below the dHash 9×8 luma quantization threshold. Spider forced regenerated (`0x461E3E1F07870C00` → `0x461E2E1F07830C00`).
- ✅ `D-093` filed in `docs/DECISIONS.md` documenting the five non-trivial decisions: worldTex sample over inline `drawWorld()`, delete vs keep `mat_frosted_glass` fallback, defer build state machine to V.7.7C.2, `2.5 × rDrop` magnification choice over `8 × rDrop` background tuning, half-vector type-correction (`float2 halfDir` not `float3 halfVec` — prompt's recipe declared a float3 with a float2 RHS, fails to compile in Metal).

**Verify:** Same as V.7.7B. Detailed protocol in `prompts/V.7.7C-prompt.md`.

**Carry-forward:**
- V.7.7C.2 / V.7.8 — single-foreground build state machine (frame → radials → INWARD spiral over 60s), per-chord drop accretion, anchor blobs.
- V.7.7D — spider pillar deepening + whole-scene 12 Hz vibration.
- V.7.10 — Matt M7 cert review.

---

### Increment V.7.7D — Arachne 3D SDF spider + chitin + listening pose + 12 Hz vibration ✅ 2026-05-08

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7C Arachne refractive dewdrops (§5.8 Snell's-law) ✅ 2026-05-07.

**Scope:** Replace the V.7.5 / V.7.7B / V.7.7C 2D dark-silhouette spider overlay in `arachne_composite_fragment` (~line 1033) with a per-pixel ray-marched 3D SDF anatomy (cephalothorax + abdomen + petiole + 8 IK legs with outward-bending knees + 6 eyes) shaded via the §6.2 chitin recipe (brown-amber base + thin-film iridescence at biological strength `blend = 0.15` + Oren-Nayar hair fuzz + per-eye specular). Add a CPU-side listening-pose state machine (`ArachneState+ListeningPose.swift`) that lifts `tip[0]` / `tip[1]` clip-space Y by `0.5 × kSpiderScale × listenLiftEMA` on sustained low-attack-ratio bass — the shader's IK derives the raised knee analytically from the lifted tip, no GPU-struct change. Add §8.2 whole-scene 12 Hz vibration UV jitter on COMPOSITE web walks + spider body translation; WORLD intentionally still. Out of scope: trigger logic, build state machine, web pool / spawn / eviction, `arachneEvalWeb` body, `mat_chitin` cookbook recipe, visual references, M7 review — V.7.7C.2 / V.7.8 / V.7.10.

**Done when:**
- ✅ 3D SDF spider renders into a `0.15 UV` screen-space patch around the spider's UV anchor; cephalothorax + abdomen + petiole + 8 IK legs + 6 eyes resolved by `sd_spider_combined` via inlined adaptive ray march (32 steps, `hitEps = 0.0008`, far plane 8.0 body-local units).
- ✅ Chitin material recipe applied at hit (matID 0/2 = body/leg): brown-amber base `(0.08, 0.05, 0.03)` + thin-film `hsv2rgb(0.55+0.3·NdotV, 0.5, 0.4) × 0.15` + Oren-Nayar fuzz `pow(1−NdotV, 1.5) × 0.18` × kLightCol + body shadow `0.30+0.70·NdotL` + warm rim `kLightCol × pow(1−NdotV, 3) × 0.55`. Eye material (matID 1): `float3(0.02) + kLightCol × spec` with `spec = (dot(halfV, n) > 0.95)`. `mat_chitin` (V.3 cookbook) NOT called from this path — its V.3 default `thin × 1.0` blend would be the §6.2 anti-reference (ref `10` neon glow).
- ✅ Listening-pose state machine fires on `f.bassDev > 0.30 AND stems.bassAttackRatio ∈ (0, 0.55)` held continuously for ≥ 1.5 s; EMA returns to 0 with `τ = 1 s` when bass eases. State lives entirely on `ArachneState` (CPU), preserving the V.7.7B 80-byte `ArachneSpiderGPU` contract. `writeSpiderToGPU()` lifts only `tip[0]` / `tip[1]` clip-Y by `0.5 × kSpiderScale × listenLiftEMA = 0.009 × EMA` UV; other tips unchanged.
- ✅ §8.2 vibration UV jitter applied at top of `arachne_composite_fragment` BEFORE web walks; `arachneEvalWeb(uv, ...)` calls (anchor + pool) replaced with `vibUV`; spider body translates with the same `vibOffset`. Bottom-of-fragment `worldTex.sample(arachne_world_sampler, uv)` keeps original `uv` (WORLD pillar intentionally still per §8.2 anchor-vs-tip physics). Driver substituted from §8.2's `subBass_dev` to FV `bass_att_rel` (FV has no sub-bass split; `bass_att_rel` is the natural Arachne continuous-bass envelope and stays at 0 at AGC-average levels — passes the PresetAcceptance "beat is accent only" invariant). Per-kick spike `0.0015 × beat_bass × 0.4` set to 0 (continuous-only is closer to §8.2 musical intent; per-kick character preserved by the existing `beatAccent` strand-emission term).
- ✅ Two-commit increment: (1) `[V.7.7D] Arachne: listening-pose state machine + tip lift CPU-side (D-094)` — `ArachneState.swift` + `ArachneState+Spider.swift` + new `ArachneState+ListeningPose.swift` + new `ArachneListeningPoseTests.swift` (4 tests); (2) `[V.7.7D] Arachne: 3D spider SDF + chitin material + 12 Hz vibration (D-094)` — `Arachne.metal` shader work + golden hashes + docs.
- ✅ Targeted suites pass (`PresetAcceptance` + `StagedComposition` + `StagedPresetBufferBinding` + `PresetRegression` + `ArachneSpiderRender` + `ArachneState` + `ArachneListeningPose` + `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` — 32 tests / 8 suites).
- ✅ `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` passes (Arachne preset count 14, no silent compile drop — Failed Approach #44).
- ✅ Visual harness `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --filter renderStagedPresetPerStage` produces non-placeholder Arachne PNGs across silence / mid / beat fixtures; beat composite (1232 KB) shows minor pattern delta vs silence/mid composites (1230 KB) confirming vibration is wired.
- ✅ 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files; full engine suite passes except documented pre-existing parallel-load flakes (`MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout`, `SessionManagerTests` — all pass in isolation).
- ✅ Golden hashes documented: Arachne `beatHeavy` regenerated to `0xC6168E87878E8480` (continuous-bass vibration shifts silk pattern by a few bits at the test fixture's `bass_att_rel`-equivalent level via the audio-coupled web walk); steady + quiet UNCHANGED. Spider forced UNCHANGED (`0x461E2E1F07830C00`) — the dHash 9×8 luma quantization at 64×64 doesn't resolve the small spider footprint's colour change; the 3D anatomy IS rendered (different colour values inside the patch) but contributes below the digest threshold. Real visual divergence observed in `PresetVisualReviewTests`.
- ✅ `D-094` filed in `docs/DECISIONS.md` documenting the eight non-trivial decisions: 3D SDF over 2D extension, screen-space patch over full-screen march, GPU-struct stability + CPU-side listening-pose, FV-vs-spec mismatch (`bassDev` for sub-bass), vibration driver `bass_att_rel` + per-kick spike dropped, COMPOSITE-only vibration scope, 8×8 phase quantization, `spiderLegRadius` left at 0.26 + patch widened to 0.15.

**Verify:** Detailed protocol in `prompts/V.7.7D-prompt.md`. Order matters: build → `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` → targeted suites → visual harness → spider golden hash regeneration → full engine suite.

**Carry-forward:**
- V.7.7C.2 / V.7.8 — single-foreground build state machine (frame → radials → INWARD spiral over 60s), per-chord drop accretion, anchor blobs, per-segment spider cooldown, build pause/resume on spider trigger.
- V.7.10 — Matt M7 contact-sheet review + cert. Gated on V.7.7C.2 / V.7.8 + V.7.7D landing.

---

### Increment V.7.7C.2 — Arachne single-foreground build state machine + background pool + per-segment spider cooldown + PresetSignaling + WebGPU Row 5 ✅ 2026-05-09

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7D Arachne 3D SDF spider + chitin + listening pose + vibration ✅ 2026-05-08.

**Scope:** Replace the V.7.5 4-web pool-with-beat-measured stage timing with a single-foreground build state machine implementing `ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md §5` orb-weaver biology (frame polygon → bridge thread first → alternating-pair radials → INWARD chord-segment capture spiral → settle), audio-modulated TIME pacing, 1–2 saturated background webs at depth, per-segment spider cooldown replacing V.7.5's 300 s session lock, build pause/resume on spider trigger, `PresetSignaling` conformance emitting `presetCompletionEvent` once at settle, and `ArachneWebGPU` extension 80 → 96 bytes (Row 5 = packed BuildState). Three commits across two days. The dispatched Arachne preset becomes the visible build cycle the v8 design has been working toward since D-072 — Matt watches a single foreground web draw itself over ~50–55 s of music in a depth context of finished background webs. Subsumes the original V.7.8 (foreground build refactor) and V.7.9 (spider deepening + vibration + cert) plans — those V.7.5-era line items are obsolete post-V.7.7C/D + V.7.7C.2.

**Done when:**

- ✅ Commit 1 (`38d1bfab`, 2026-05-08) — WORLD branch-anchor twigs. `kBranchAnchors[6]` constant in `Arachne.metal` + `ArachneState.branchAnchors` Swift mirror; `drawWorld()` renders six small dark capsule SDFs at those positions. `ArachneBranchAnchorsTests` regression-locks the Swift / MSL sync via string-search.
- ✅ Commit 2 (`0f94be2f`, 2026-05-08) — CPU build state machine + background pool + spider integration. `ArachneBuildState` struct on `ArachneState` (frame / radial / spiral / stable / evicting), audio-modulated TIME pacing (`pace = 1.0 + 0.18 × midAttRel + max(0, 0.5 × drumsEnergyDev)` — D-026 ratio ≈ 3.6×), pause guard evaluated BEFORE `effectiveDt` per RISKS, alternating-pair radial draw order (§5.5), spiral chord precompute with strictly-INWARD chord radii (§5.6), per-chord `spiralChordBirthTimes[]` for §5.8 accretion, polygon selection via Fisher-Yates from `branchAnchors[6]` + bridge-pair largest-angular-gap heuristic, `reset()` semantics. New `ArachneState+BackgroundWebs.swift` (1–2 saturated entries, migration crossfade 1 s ramp). New `ArachneStateSignaling.swift` (in `Sources/Orchestrator/` for module-cycle avoidance — D-095 documents the deviation from spec'd `Sources/Presets/Arachnid/` placement). `spiderFiredInSegment: Bool` per-segment cooldown replaces V.7.5's 300 s session lock (§6.5). `WebGPU` extended 80 → 96 bytes (Row 5 = build_stage / frame_progress / radial_packed / spiral_packed). 11 new `ArachneStateBuild` tests + 1 legacy-test rewrite. App-layer wiring: `applyPreset .staged` calls `arachneState.reset()` for Arachne; `activePresetSignaling()` `as?` cast simplified.
- ✅ Commit 3 (this commit, 2026-05-09) — shader-side build-aware rendering + golden hash regen + docs. `arachne_composite_fragment`'s "Permanent anchor web" block now reads `webs[0]` Row 5 BuildState and maps it to the legacy `(stage, progress)` signature `arachneEvalWeb` already understands: `.frame (0)` → `stage=0u, progress=frame_progress`; `.radial (1)` → `stage=1u, progress=radial_packed / 13.0`; `.spiral (2)` → `stage=2u, progress=spiral_packed / 104.0`; `≥ .stable (3)` → `stage=3u, progress=1.0`. Pool loop starts at `wi = 1` so the foreground slot doesn't double-render. The chord-segment SDF stays `sd_segment_2d` (Failed Approach #34 lock); the §5.4 hub knot stays `fbm4`-min threshold-clipped (NOT concentric rings); the §5.8 drop COLOR recipe is byte-identical to V.7.7C (D-093 lock); the V.7.7D 3D SDF spider + chitin + listening pose + 12 Hz vibration are byte-identical (D-094 lock); `ArachneSpiderGPU` stays at 80 bytes. `PresetAcceptanceTests.makeRenderBuffers` seeds the slot-6 buffer with stable BuildState values for Arachne specifically, mirroring `arachneState.reset()` in production.
- ✅ Targeted suites pass (`PresetAcceptance` + `StagedComposition` + `StagedPresetBufferBinding` + `PresetRegression` + `ArachneSpiderRender` + `ArachneState` + `ArachneStateBuild` + `ArachneListeningPose` + `ArachneBranchAnchors` + `PresetLoaderCompileFailure`). 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files. Engine 1170/1171 pass — sole failure is the documented pre-existing `MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout` parallel-load flake. App suite: 5 timing flakes mirroring Commit 2's documented baseline.
- ✅ Golden hashes regenerated. Arachne `steady` / `beatHeavy` / `quiet` all converge to `0xC6168081C0D88880` (mid-build composition; harness's shared 30-tick warmup gives the same BuildState for all three fixtures). Hamming distance from V.7.7D `steady` (`0xC6168E8F87868C80`): 16 bits, within the D-095 expected [10, 30] band. Spider forced hash: `0x461E2E1F07830C00` → `0x461E381912D80800` (14 bits drift).
- ✅ Visual harness PNG (`/tmp/phosphene_visual/20260508T153154/`): foreground hero (V.7.7D upper-left) gone — at warmup t=0.5s the BuildState is in frame phase at frameProgress ≈ 0.166 (only the partial bridge thread renders, visually subtle). Background depth context (webs[1] at lower-right, V.7.5 spawn/eviction) renders unchanged. PNG size dropped 1.16 MB → 0.72 MB on the composite, consistent with the foreground hero disappearing. Real-music build cycle visible only on Matt's manual smoke gate.
- ✅ `D-095` filed in `docs/DECISIONS.md` documenting all decisions: single foreground hero + background pool, audio-modulated TIME pacing, per-segment spider cooldown, build pause/resume invariant, `PresetSignaling` conformance + `ArachneStateSignaling.swift` placement in Orchestrator module, WebGPU 80 → 96 bytes Row 5 layout, `branchAnchors` two-source-of-truth, hub knot fbm-clipped (not concentric rings), Failed Approach #34 chord SDF lock, polygon-irregular-by-construction. Plus four explicit deferred sub-items: per-chord drop accretion via chord-age side buffer, anchor-blob discs at polygon vertices, background-web migration crossfade rendered visual, polygon vertices from `branchAnchors` (vs spoke tips). None load-bearing for the success criterion ("the user watches the build draw itself"); schedule alongside V.7.10 cert review at Matt's discretion.

**Verify:** Detailed protocol in `prompts/V.7.7C.2-prompt.md`, `V.7.7C.2-commit2-prompt.md`, `V.7.7C.2-commit3-prompt.md`. Order matters: preconditions (build / stride 96 / completion event single-fire / pre-shader regression baseline) → `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` → targeted suites pre-golden → visual harness sanity check (silence vs beat composite delta, hub not concentric, polygon irregular, spiral inward) → golden hash regen → targeted suites post-golden → full engine suite → app suite → SwiftLint → manual smoke (Matt watches build cycle on real music).

**Carry-forward:** V.7.10 — Matt M7 contact-sheet review + cert sign-off. The Arachne 2D stream's structural work is complete after V.7.7C.2; V.7.10 is QA + sign-off only. V.8.x (Arachne3D parallel preset, D-096) deferred per Matt's 2026-05-08 sequencing call — simpler presets first, then return to V.8.1.

### Increment V.7.7C.3 — Arachne manual-smoke remediation: chord-by-chord spiral + V.7.5 pool retire + branchAnchors polygon + spider trigger reformulation ✅ 2026-05-09

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7C.2 single-foreground build state machine ✅ 2026-05-09.

**Scope:** Close four issues surfaced by Matt's 2026-05-08T17-01-15Z manual smoke that V.7.7C.2's deferred-sub-items list either deferred or did not anticipate. (1) Chord-by-chord spiral visibility gate — replace per-ring gate with per-chord gate so chords lay one-at-a-time outside-in, not full-ring complete ovals. (2) Retire V.7.5 spawn/eviction from rendering — disable shader pool loop entirely so flash-and-fade transient webs no longer compete with the foreground build. (3) Polygon vertices from `branchAnchors` (V.7.7C.2 deferred sub-item #4 lifted from deferred) — pack `bs.anchors[]` into `webs[0].rngSeed`; shader decodes + ray-clips spokes to polygon perimeter + uses irregular polyV[] for frame thread vertices with bridge-first stage-0 reveal. (4) Spider trigger reformulated — V.7.5 `subBass + bassAttackRatio < 0.55` gate confirmed acoustically impossible on real music (Failed Approach #57); replace with `bassAttRel` envelope primitive (same primitive the §8.2 vibration path uses correctly). Single commit. No new tests; only fixture-helper updates + golden hash regen (spider only).

**Done when:**

- ✅ Per-chord spiral visibility gate in `arachneEvalWeb`: `int totalChordCount = N_RINGS * nSpk; int visibleChordCount = (stage >= 3u) ? totalChordCount : ((stage == 2u) ? int(progress * totalChordCount) : 0)`. Inner spoke loop skips chords with `globalChordIdx >= visibleChordCount`. Sweep order: outside-in by ring (k=0 outermost, first), clockwise-by-spoke within each ring (`globalChordIdx = k * nSpk + si`).
- ✅ V.7.5 pool spawn/eviction retired from rendering: shader's pool loop bound changed from `wi < kArachWebs` to `wi < 1` (empty body retained as a structural marker for the future §5.12 background-web flush). CPU-side spawn/eviction state continues to advance harmlessly so `ArachneState` unit tests still cover the spawn machinery; nothing reaches the shader.
- ✅ Polygon-from-branchAnchors path: new `Self.packPolygonAnchors(_:)` static helper on `ArachneState` packs up to 6 anchor indices (4 bits count + 6 × 4 bits indices) into a single `UInt32`. `writeBuildStateToWebs0` writes the packed value to `webs[0].rngSeed`. Three new shader helpers above `arachneEvalWeb`: `decodePolygonAnchors`, `rayPolygonHit`, `findBridgeIndex`. `arachneEvalWeb` extended with `int polyCount, thread const float2 *polyV` parameters. Inside: squash transform bypassed in polygon mode; spoke tip computation clipped to polygon (used for both alternating-pair tipPos[] and sequential sdTip[]); frame thread polygon vertices come from polyV[] with bridge-first stage-0 reveal (`edgeIdx = (bridgeIdx + fi) % frameVCount`); spiral chord positions scaled along each spoke's polygon-clipped length (`pI = sdTip[si] * fracR + sag`, `fracR = ringR / r_outer`). V.7.5 fallback path preserved bytewise when `polyCount = 0`. Three call sites updated.
- ✅ Spider trigger reformulated: `features.subBass > 0.30 AND stems.bassAttackRatio > 0 AND < 0.55` → `features.bassAttRel > Self.bassAttRelThreshold` (0.30). AR gate retired; brief kick pulses filtered by existing 0.75 s sustain-accumulator threshold. Trigger log line shows `bassAttRel` alongside `subBass` for diagnostic continuity.
- ✅ Targeted suites pass (`PresetAcceptance` 56/56 + `StagedComposition` + `StagedPresetBufferBinding` + `ArachneState` + `ArachneStateBuild` 11/11 + `ArachneListeningPose` + `ArachneBranchAnchors` + `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` + `PresetRegression` + `ArachneSpiderRender`). 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files. Engine 1169/1171 pass (2 documented pre-existing flakes).
- ✅ Golden hashes regenerated. Arachne `steady` / `beatHeavy` / `quiet` UNCHANGED at `0xC6168081C0D88880` (PresetRegression doesn't bind slot 6/7 → polyCount=0 V.7.5 fallback + frame phase at 0 % progress = WORLD-only composition). Spider forced: `0x461E381912D80800` → `0x46160011C2D80800` (7 bits drift; within dHash 8-bit tolerance — polygon-aware spoke clipping visibly affects only partial-bridge-thread pixels under the spider patch at the harness's frame-phase warmup).
- ✅ Spider tests updated for `bassAttRel` primitive: `subBassFV()` in `ArachneStateTests` + `bassTriggerFV()` in `ArachneStateBuildTests` set `f.bassAttRel = 0.40` (above threshold). `ArachneSpiderRenderTests` calls `state.reset()` before warmup so polygon path is exercised; `PresetAcceptanceTests` slot-6 buffer additionally seeds packed polygon at `webs[0].rngSeed` (byte offset 28).
- ✅ `D-095` follow-up section filed in `docs/DECISIONS.md` documenting all four fixes + V.7.7C.2 contract preservation guarantees + Failed Approach #57.

**Verify:** Build → `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` → targeted suites pre-golden → visual harness sanity check → golden hash regen (spider only) → targeted suites post-golden → full engine + app suites → SwiftLint → manual smoke re-run (Matt watches build cycle on real music; verifies chord-by-chord lay, no transient web churn, irregular polygon, spider triggers on Limit To Your Love sub-bass drop).

**Carry-forward:** Manual-smoke re-run on real music (Matt). On green: V.7.10 cert review. Three V.7.10 follow-ups remain: per-chord drop accretion via chord-age side buffer; anchor-blob discs at polygon vertices (§5.9 part 2); background-web migration crossfade rendered visual.

### Increment V.7.7C.4 — Arachne palette + L lock + hybrid audio coupling (D-095 follow-up #2) ✅ 2026-05-09

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7C.3 manual-smoke remediation ✅ 2026-05-09.

**Scope:** Close three issues from Matt's 2026-05-08T18-28-16Z second manual smoke. WORLD reframe + spider movement deferred to V.7.7C.5 + V.7.7C.6 per Matt's sequencing call. **Fix A:** L key full-lock — `handlePresetCompletionEvent` guards on `diagnosticPresetLocked` so orchestrator-driven completion-event transitions are suppressed when the L key is held. Pre-V.7.7C.4 the L key only suppressed mood-override switching; V.7.7C.4 lets Matt watch the full ~50–55 s build cycle without the orchestrator cycling away every ~60 s. Manual `⌘[` / `⌘]` cycling unaffected. **Fix B:** Palette enrichment — reverses V.7.5 §10.1.3's deliberate silk dimming after Matt's "color far too subtle" feedback. silkTint factor 0.60 → 0.85; mood-driven hue base (valence: teal → amber); vocal-pitch coupling when `stems.vocals_pitch_confidence ≥ 0.35` (Gossamer-style); wider hueDrift factor 0.10 → 0.20; ambient tint factor 0.25 → 0.40; hub knot coverage 0.80 → 1.20 (saturated). **Fix C:** Hybrid audio coupling — PRESERVES D-095 Decision 2 (audio-modulated TIME pacing) while adding two beat-coupling channels. (1) Per-beat global emission pulse `emGain += beatPulse * 0.06` where `beatPulse = max(beat_bass, beat_composite)`. Coefficient 0.06 calibrated against PresetAcceptance D-037 invariant 3 (`beatMotion ≤ continuousMotion × 2.0 + 1.0`). (2) Rising-edge beat advances `spiralChordIndex` by 1 in `advanceSpiralPhase(by:features:)`. New `ArachneState.prevBeatForSpiral` rising-edge tracker (reset by `_reset()`). Sparse-beat tracks still complete in `naturalCycleSeconds`; kick-heavy tracks see chords lay faster on each beat. Pause-guard preserved: gated on `effectiveDt > 0`. Single commit; no new test files (only fixture-helper updates + golden hash regen).

**Done when:**

- ✅ L key suppresses orchestrator-driven completion-event transitions when held. `handlePresetCompletionEvent` checks `diagnosticPresetLocked` first, logs `"Orchestrator: preset completion suppressed (diagnosticPresetLocked)"` and returns early.
- ✅ Silk palette: silkTint 0.85; hue derived from valence-driven base + vocal-pitch coupling (when `stems.vocals_pitch_confidence ≥ 0.35`); hueDrift coefficient 0.20; ambient 0.40. Hub knot coverage 1.20 saturated (visibly distinct emissive feature).
- ✅ Per-beat global emission pulse `beatPulse * 0.06` on silk emission. Calibrated against D-037 invariant 3.
- ✅ Rising-edge beat advances `spiralChordIndex` in `advanceSpiralPhase(by:features:)`. `prevBeatForSpiral` tracker on `ArachneState` reset by `_reset()`. Pause-guard preserved (gated on `effectiveDt > 0`).
- ✅ Targeted suites pass (`PresetAcceptance` 60/60 + `StagedComposition` + `StagedPresetBufferBinding` + `ArachneState` + `ArachneStateBuild` + `ArachneListeningPose` + `ArachneBranchAnchors` + `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` + `PresetRegression` + `ArachneSpiderRender`). PresetAcceptance D-037 invariant 3 caught initial coefficient overshoot (0.45 → 0.06 retune); test infrastructure worked exactly as intended.
- ✅ Engine 1174/1175 pass (sole `MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout` documented flake). App suite: same documented flake (better than V.7.7C.2/C.3 baseline). 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files (file_length 400 line ceiling on `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` enforced — comment trimmed during landing).
- ✅ Golden hashes regenerated. Arachne `steady`/`quiet` `0xC6168081C0D88880` → `0x06129A65E458494D`; `beatHeavy` → `0x0000000000000000`. Spider forced: `0x46160011C2D80800` → `0x06129A55C258494D`.
- ✅ D-095 follow-up section in `docs/DECISIONS.md` documenting the three fixes + V.7.7C.2/C.3 contract preservation.

**Verify:** Build → `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` → targeted suites pre-golden → visual harness sanity check → golden hash regen → targeted suites post-golden → full engine + app suites → SwiftLint → manual smoke re-run (Matt verifies L lock holds, palette reads brighter, build couples to beats).

**Carry-forward:** Manual-smoke re-run on real music (Matt). On green: V.7.7C.5 (WORLD reframe) and V.7.7C.6 (spider movement). V.7.10 cert review still gated on these.

---

### Increment V.7.7C.5 — Arachne atmospheric abstraction (WORLD reframe) ✅ 2026-05-08

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7C.4 manual-smoke green sign-off — **confirmed by Matt 2026-05-08 (this session).** §4 spec revision landed 2026-05-09 in `docs/presets/ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md` (full §4 rewrite from "six-layer dark close-up forest" to "two-layer atmospheric abstraction"; §5.9 updated to retire literal branch/twig rendering; §4.5 decisions log captures all 13 Q&A answers Matt provided).

**Scope:** Implement the V.7.7C.5 §4 + §5.9 spec revision. Single-commit increment. Replaces `drawWorld()` in `Arachne.metal` (currently the V.7.7B six-layer dark close-up forest with §5.9 anchor twigs added in V.7.7C.2 Commit 1) with a two-layer atmospheric backdrop:

1. **Atmospheric color band (full frame).** Vertical gradient `mix(botCol, topCol, uv.y)` over the full frame (expanded from V.7.7B's upper 40 %). Low-frequency `fbm4` noise modulation. Aurora ribbons at high arousal (preserved from V.7.7B). Silence-anchor pure-black preserved.
2. **Volumetric atmosphere** (three sub-elements composited additively):
   - Fog density anchored around the light shaft cones (denser inside cones, thinner outside) — volumetric god-ray signature. Range raised from 0.02–0.06 to **0.15–0.30**. Inside cones: `mix(botCol, topCol, 0.5) × kLightCol`. Outside: `mix(botCol, topCol, 0.5) × 0.3`.
   - Light shafts: 1–2 god-ray cones, mood-driven angle (warm valence → upper-LEFT, cool valence → upper-RIGHT, ~30° from vertical for primary, ~50° for optional secondary at high arousal). Brightness coefficient raised from `0.06 × val` to **`0.30 × val`** so shafts read as hero atmospheric elements. Engages above `f.mid_att_rel > 0.05` (lowered from V.7.7B's 0.10). Use `Volume/LightShafts.metal` `ls_radial_step_uv` family.
   - Dust motes concentrated INSIDE the shaft cones only (caustic-like), per-mote opacity 0.4 (raised from 0.3), color `local_fog × kLightCol`, density modulated by `f.mid_att_rel`, phase-anchored to `f.beat_phase01` (Failed Approach #33 compliance).

**Retired (V.7.7C.5):**

- Distant tree silhouettes (V.7.7B §4.2.2)
- Mid-distance trees with bark detail (V.7.7B §4.2.3)
- Near-frame branches (V.7.7B §4.2.4) — `drawWorld()` branch-rendering loops removed
- Forest floor (V.7.7B §4.2.5) — sky band fills the lower edge instead
- §5.9 anchor twigs (V.7.7C.2 Commit 1) — `drawWorld()` capsule-SDF loop at `kBranchAnchors[i]` positions removed. **`kBranchAnchors[6]` constants stay** in `Arachne.metal` and `ArachneState.swift` — `selectPolygon(rng:)` still consumes them as polygon vertex candidates; `ArachneBranchAnchorsTests` regression test stays.
- Forest-specific reference images for §4 implementation: `02_meso_per_strand_sag.jpg`, `11_anchor_web_in_branch_frame.jpg`, `17_floor_moss_leaf_litter.jpg`, `18_bark_close_up.jpg`. They stay in `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/arachne/` for V.7.10 historical comparison; they no longer drive any §4 implementation choice.

**Preserved (V.7.7C.5):**

- §4.3 mood-driven color field — verbatim from 2026-05-02 spec (Q10).
- Silence anchor `(satScale × valScale) < 0.05` clears WORLD to black (Q11).
- WEB pillar (§5) entirely — staged WORLD + COMPOSITE scaffold, build state machine, polygon-from-`branchAnchors`, drop refraction recipe, 3D SDF spider, 12 Hz vibration.
- `ArachneState.branchAnchors[]` + `kBranchAnchors[6]` MSL constants (still used for polygon vertex selection).

**Done when:**

- `drawWorld()` rewritten as the two-layer atmospheric backdrop. Six-layer forest content + §5.9 anchor-twig SDF loop removed.
- Sky band gradient covers full frame (uv.y from 0 to 1).
- Volumetric fog anchored around shaft cones, range 0.15–0.30.
- Light shafts 1–2 mood-driven angle, brightness coefficient 0.30 × val, engages above `f.mid_att_rel > 0.05`.
- Dust motes concentrated inside shaft cones only, beat-phase-anchored.
- Silence anchor `(satScale × valScale) < 0.05 → black` preserved.
- **Q14 — `kBranchAnchors[6]` repositioned to off-frame.** Every entry on or just past `[0,1]²` borders. Constants in `Arachne.metal` line ~153 + `ArachneState.swift` updated byte-for-byte; `ArachneBranchAnchorsTests` regenerated against new values. Web reads as anchored to off-frame structures.
- **Q15 — `webR` bumped `0.22` → `~0.55`** in `arachne_composite_fragment` foreground anchor block so the spoke distance early-exit + spiral ring sweep range accommodate the larger polygon. Polygon interior occupies ~70–85% of canvas area.
- All targeted suites pass (`PresetAcceptance`, `StagedComposition`, `StagedPresetBufferBinding`, `PresetRegression`, `ArachneSpiderRender`, `ArachneState`, `ArachneStateBuild`, `ArachneListeningPose`, `ArachneBranchAnchors`, `PresetLoaderCompileFailure`).
- Goldens regenerated — substantial drift expected (every WORLD pixel changes; foreground polygon scale changes too).
- 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files.
- New `D-099` decision in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (or next-available ID) documenting the V.7.7C.5 reframe rationale + the 15 Q&A decisions captured in §4.5.
- Manual smoke confirms backdrop reads as atmospheric support: fog visible, light shafts hero, motes glow inside shafts, no literal trees / branches / twigs anywhere. Web fills majority of canvas; anchors implied off-frame; visual signature matches `20_macro_backlit_purple_canvas_filling_web.jpg` reference.

**Verify:** Build → `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` → targeted suites pre-golden → `RENDER_VISUAL=1` visual harness sanity check (silence shows pure black; mid shows visible fog + 1 shaft + motes; beat shows shaft activated by `mid_att_rel`) → golden hash regen → targeted suites post-golden → full engine + app suites → SwiftLint → manual smoke re-run on real music (Matt verifies fog/light/mote framing dominates, no forest residue, build cycle still readable on top).

**Estimated sessions:** 1 (single-commit increment; §4 spec is fully resolved).

**Landed (2026-05-08, single commit).** Files: `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Arachne.metal` (drawWorld rewritten — sky band + beam-anchored fog + 1–2 mood-driven shafts at `0.30 × val` + cone-confined dust motes; midAttRel parameter threaded; foreground hero hub at `(0.5, 0.5)` + `webR = 0.55`; per-beat coefficient retuned `0.06 → 0.025` for canvas-filling area scale per D-100); `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Arachnid/ArachneState.swift` (`branchAnchors` Swift mirror moved off-frame; `webs[0]` hub `(0.0, 0.0)` / radius `1.10`); `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/ArachneBranchAnchorsTests.swift` (expected literals + bounds invariant rewritten for `[-0.06, 1.06]²`; new asymmetry test); `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/ArachneSpiderRenderTests.swift` (`goldenSpiderForcedHash` `0x06129A55C258494D → 0x06D29A65E458494D` — 7-bit Hamming drift from off-frame anchors flowing into polygon decode); `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Renderer/PresetRegressionTests.swift` (Arachne `beatHeavy` `0x0000000000000000 → 0xC6921125C4D85849`; steady/quiet UNCHANGED — regression harness doesn't bind slot 6/7 + worldTex; comment block extended). Engine 1184 tests / 2 documented pre-existing flakes (`MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout`, `SoakTestHarness.cancel`); app build clean; SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files; `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` passes. PresetAcceptance D-037 invariant 3 passes for Arachne after coefficient retune (predicted MSE ≈ 0.31 vs ceiling 1.0). RENDER_VISUAL=1 PNGs at `/tmp/phosphene_visual/20260508T213106/Arachne_{silence,mid,beat}_{world,composite}.png`. D-100.

**Carry-forward:** Manual smoke re-run completed 2026-05-08T22-01-07Z. Geometry contracts (canvas-filling polygon, off-frame anchors, hub at canvas centre, chord-by-chord lay) all read correctly. Cosmetic + palette feedback drove V.7.7C.5.1 (below). V.7.7C.6 (spider movement) and V.7.10 (cert review) remain.

### Increment V.7.7C.5.1 — Arachne visual craft pass (line widths + luminescence + palette + shaft gate + per-segment seed) ✅ 2026-05-08

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7C.5 manual smoke completed. Matt's 2026-05-08T22-01-07Z session surfaced six issues with V.7.7C.5's visual craft despite the geometry contracts reading correctly:

1. **Spirals too fast — chord-by-chord not readable.** Reframed by Matt: "webs are elaborate, so viewers should expect tighter spirals with many points of connection. The lines and luminescence on them do not need to be so heavy." → keep chord density; thin the lines + dim luminescence so density reads as elaborate detail rather than scribbly chaos.
2. **Lines too thick relative to canvas-filling polygon.** Silk widths were absolute UV; at V.7.7C.4 webR=0.22 they were balanced; at V.7.7C.5 webR=0.55 the polygon scaled 2.5× but lines didn't.
3. **Toddler-drawing readability** — downstream of (1) + (2).
4. **Spider didn't fire on LTYL.** Recording cut at LTYL +35 s, before the song's sub-bass drop. Inconclusive; deferred to longer-LTYL smoke.
5. **Background palette too muted — psych ward, not psychedelic.** V.7.7C.5 shipped Q10's verbatim §4.3 palette (sat 0.25–0.65 / val 0.10–0.30), correct for the V.7.7B–C.4 forest WORLD where compositional richness masked the muteness; the atmospheric reframe exposed it.
6. **No light shaft appreciated.** Telemetry from the 4705-frame Arachne windows showed midAttRel mean ≈ -0.5, max never reached the §4.2.2 spec gate threshold of 0.05 → shaft never engaged.

Plus a separate observation: "should the preset draw the SAME web in the SAME position EVERY time? Shouldn't it vary every time you play it, or based on the track it's paired with?" → per-segment macro-shape variation needed.

**Scope:** Single-commit cosmetic + per-segment-seed pass on V.7.7C.5. No Swift state changes; no test rewrites; only line widths, luminescence constants, palette function rewrite, shaft gate reformulation, ancSeed source, plus golden hash regen.

**Done when:**

- Silk line widths halved: spoke/frame `0.0024 → 0.0010`, spiral `0.0013 → 0.0007`. Halo sigmas halved to match.
- Silk luminescence dimmed: silkTint factor `0.85 → 0.55`; hub knot coverage `1.20 → 0.70`; ambient tint factor `0.40 → 0.20`; axial highlight coefficient `0.6 → 0.3`; halo magnitudes ~halved (`spokeHalo 0.38 → 0.20`, `frameHalo 0.22 → 0.11`, `spirHalo 0.25 → 0.13`).
- §4.3 palette pumped: saturation `0.55–0.95`, value `0.30–0.70`. Audio-time hue cycle ±0.15 swing on top of the Q10 valence-driven base hues. Top/bottom phase-offset by π so the gradient never collapses to a single hue.
- Shaft engagement gate reformulated: `0.25 + 0.75 × smoothstep(-0.20, 0.10, midAttRel)`. Floors engagement at 25% always-on baseline; scales to 100% on positive deviation.
- Cross-preset silence anchor preserved (Q11) by re-keying on raw mood product `arousalNorm × valenceNorm < 0.05`.
- Per-segment macro-shape variation (Option A): `ancSeed = arachHashU32(webs[0].rng_seed ^ 0xCA51u)` instead of hardcoded `1984u`. New `arachHashU32` helper — same bit-mixing as `arachHash` but returns the scrambled uint instead of a float.
- All targeted suites pass (`PresetAcceptance`, `StagedComposition`, `StagedPresetBufferBinding`, `PresetRegression`, `ArachneSpiderRender`, `ArachneState`, `ArachneStateBuild`, `ArachneListeningPose`, `ArachneBranchAnchors`, `PresetLoaderCompileFailure`).
- Goldens regenerated (Arachne `steady`/`quiet` `0x06129A65E458494D → 0x8000000000000000` — V.7.7C.5.1 dimmed silk pushes frame-phase-0 contribution below dHash quantization on the regression harness; `beatHeavy` `0xC6921125C4D85849 → 0x04101A6444186969`; spider forced `0x06D29A65E458494D → 0x800080C004000000`).
- 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files.
- `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` passes.

**Verify:** Build → targeted suites green → `RENDER_VISUAL=1` visual harness shows vivid green-yellow gradient + thin silk → full engine + app suites → SwiftLint → manual smoke re-run on real music (Matt verifies palette psychedelic not psych ward; lines fine-detail not toddler scribble; shaft visible at baseline; per-segment variation reads as different webs across multiple Arachne instances).

**Estimated sessions:** 1 (single-commit cosmetic pass).

**Landed (2026-05-08, single commit).** Files: `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Arachne.metal` (arachHashU32 helper added; silk line widths + halo sigmas + halo magnitudes halved in `arachneEvalWeb`; foreground anchor block silk luminescence dimmed; ancSeed switched to per-segment `arachHashU32(webs[0].rng_seed ^ 0xCA51u)`; §4.3 palette rewritten with pumped sat/val + audio-time hue cycle; shaft engagement gate reformulated to floor+scale); `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/ArachneSpiderRenderTests.swift` (`goldenSpiderForcedHash` regen); `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Renderer/PresetRegressionTests.swift` (Arachne 3-tuple regen, comment block extended). Engine 1185 tests / 3 documented pre-existing parallel-load timing flakes (`MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout`, `SoakTestHarness.cancel`, `SessionManagerCancel.cancel_fromReady`); app build clean; SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files. RENDER_VISUAL=1 PNGs at `/tmp/phosphene_visual/20260508T224311/`. D-100.

**Carry-forward:** Manual smoke 2026-05-08T22-58-49Z surfaced four issues — drops piling into "fat crayon" spirals, silk wisps with no scaffold, only-green palette across a multi-track session, spider didn't fire on Love Rehab. All addressed in V.7.7C.5.2 (below). V.7.7C.5.3 (per-track web identity, Options B/C) deferred awaiting product call. V.7.7C.6 (spider movement) and V.7.10 (cert review) still remain.

---

### Increment V.7.7C.5.2 — Arachne second cosmetic + spider-trigger pass (drops + silk re-brightening + hue cycle widening + spider sustain) ✅ 2026-05-08

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7C.5.1 manual smoke completed. Matt's 2026-05-08T22-58-49Z session surfaced four issues despite the V.7.7C.5.1 cosmetic + palette pump:

1. **Spirals "large and thick like a fat crayon"** — diagnosed as drops (radius `0.008` UV ≈ 8.6 px) piling up along chord segments at 4–5 drop-diameter spacing. The chord SDF (0.0007 UV) is invisible under the drop chain. Drops carry the visual mass that V.7.5 §10.1.3 intended ("drops as visual hero") but at canvas-filling scale that produces the fat-crayon reading.
2. **Radials "wispy, no solid scaffold"** — V.7.7C.5.1 dimmed silkTint to 0.55 to compensate for the muted V.7.7C.5 backdrop, but V.7.7C.5.1 ALSO pumped the §4.3 palette to vivid sat 0.55–0.95 / val 0.30–0.70. Against the new vivid backdrop, 0.55 silkTint reads as faint cream-on-yellow with no contrast.
3. **"Only green, no other colors"** — V.7.7C.5.1's ±0.15 audio-time hue cycle stays inside one valence-quadrant neighborhood across a session.
4. **Spider didn't fire on Love Rehab** despite max bassAttRel = 1.86 (4.6 % of frames > 0.30 trigger). The 0.75 s sustain accumulator with 2× decay-when-below requires SUSTAINED bass; kick-driven music produces ~5–10 frames above threshold then ~30+ below, so the accumulator never reaches 0.75 s.

**Scope:** Single-commit cosmetic + spider-trigger pass on V.7.7C.5.1. No state-machine changes; only drop radius, silk constants, hue cycle amplitude, and sustain threshold. Plus golden hash regen.

**Done when:**

- Drop radius halved `0.008 → 0.004` (~4 px at 1080 p) so pearls read as discrete dewdrops along thin chords instead of a continuous fat band.
- Silk re-brightened: silkTint factor `0.55 → 0.70`, ambient tint factor `0.20 → 0.30`. Restores radial contrast vs the vivid backdrop without going back to V.7.7C.4's 0.85.
- Audio-time hue cycle widened `±0.15 → ±0.45`. Backdrop visibly traverses cyan → green → yellow → amber → magenta every ~25 s instead of staying in one hue band.
- Spider sustained-trigger threshold lowered `0.75 s → 0.4 s` so kick-driven music can accumulate (still rejects single-kick spikes — one ~5-frame burst contributes ~83 ms).
- All targeted suites pass (`PresetAcceptance`, `StagedComposition`, `StagedPresetBufferBinding`, `PresetRegression`, `ArachneSpiderRender`, `ArachneState`, `ArachneStateBuild`, `ArachneListeningPose`, `ArachneBranchAnchors`, `PresetLoaderCompileFailure`).
- Goldens regenerated (Arachne `(steady, beatHeavy, quiet)` `(0x8000000000000000, 0x04101A6444186969, 0x8000000000000000) → (0x0000000000000000, 0x66929B65E4D94849, 0x0000000000000000)`; spider forced `0x800080C004000000 → 0x000080C004000000`).
- 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files.
- `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` passes.

**Verify:** Build → targeted suites pre-golden → goldens regen → targeted suites post-golden → `RENDER_VISUAL=1` visual harness shows green-to-magenta gradient + thin sharp silk → full engine + app suites → SwiftLint → manual smoke re-run on real music (Matt verifies: discrete dewdrops along thin chords not fat crayon; radial scaffold visible; backdrop cycles through hues across a track; spider fires on Love Rehab kicks).

**Estimated sessions:** 1 (single-commit cosmetic + sustain-tuning pass).

**Landed (2026-05-08, single commit).** Files: `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Arachne.metal` (drop radius 0.008→0.004 in arachneEvalWeb; silkTint 0.55→0.70 + ambient 0.20→0.30 in foreground anchor block; hue cycle ±0.15→±0.45 in drawWorld); `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Arachnid/ArachneState+Spider.swift` (`sustainedTriggerThreshold` 0.75→0.4); `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/ArachneSpiderRenderTests.swift` (golden regen); `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Renderer/PresetRegressionTests.swift` (golden regen). Engine 1185 tests / 2–5 documented pre-existing parallel-load timing flakes; app build clean; SwiftLint 0 violations. RENDER_VISUAL=1 PNGs at `/tmp/phosphene_visual/20260508T232351/`. D-100 follow-up #2.

**Carry-forward:** Manual smoke re-run on real music (Matt verifies the four V.7.7C.5.2 fixes deliver the expected reading on Love Rehab + LTYL — drops as discrete pearls; radials as solid scaffold; multi-hue gradient cycling; spider fires on kick drums). V.7.7C.5.3 (per-track web identity, Options B/C) deferred awaiting product call. V.7.7C.6 (spider movement) and V.7.10 (cert review) still remain.

---

### Increment V.7.7C.5.3 — Per-track web identity (Options B / C) — DEFERRED, awaiting product decision

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7C.5.2 manual-smoke green sign-off. Renumbered from V.7.7C.5.2 after that slot was claimed by the second cosmetic pass. Decision pending Matt's evaluation of whether the Option A per-segment variation (landed in V.7.7C.5.1) is sufficient or whether webs should additionally be tied to track identity for aesthetic association.

**Scope (if scheduled):** Two flavours, mutually-exclusive:

- **Option B — per-track determinism.** Plumb track-identity hash into `ArachneState.reset(trackSeed:)`. Same track always gets the same web (across replays, across sessions). Adds Swift wiring in `ArachneState` (new `reset` overload), a Renderer hook on track change (`PresetSignaling`-style identity passthrough), and a determinism test asserting two `reset(trackSeed:)` calls with the same seed produce byte-identical web state. ~30 LOC + 1 test.

- **Option C — track + session-counter perturbation.** Per-track base seed gives identity; an LCG step per-replay gives variant on the Nth listen. Variety + association both. ~40 LOC + extends the determinism test with a per-replay variance assertion (Nth replay produces materially-different web state from N+1th replay).

Trade-off: B gives consistent music-visual association at the cost of "this track's web always looks weak when it lands on a poor random draw"; C resolves that but adds session state (LCG-per-track replay counter) that needs persistence across track changes within a session.

**Done when:** Manual smoke confirms the chosen flavour reads as intended on a 10+-track playlist with at least one repeated track. V.7.7C.5.1's Option A is preserved as the fallback when no track identity is available (e.g. ad-hoc reactive sessions before track change observation).

**Estimated sessions:** 1 (single Swift-side commit).

---

### Increment V.7.7C.6 — Arachne spider movement system (off-camera entry + walking path + min-visibility latch + rarity gate) — DEFERRED, V.7.7D-scale increment

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7C.4 manual-smoke green sign-off + V.7.7D 3D SDF spider + V.7.7C.4 trigger reformulation already landed.

**Scope:** Add body translation + waypoint navigation + min-visibility latch + N-segment rarity gate to the existing static-position spider. Per Matt's 2026-05-08T18-28-16Z manual smoke: "the spider flashed on the screen for a second then immediately disappeared. I would want the spider to walk from off camera into the camera frame when triggered and move from one hook of the web to another over the span of 10–15 seconds. The trigger should be rare, but the spider should remain in view for longer, and most importantly should MOVE within the camera frame, ideally along the web." Closes V.7.7C.4's deferred sub-item — comparable scope to the V.7.7D 3D anatomy + chitin material increment.

**Architecture decisions (to be filed as D-100 or next-available decision ID at implementation time):**

1. **`SpiderState` enum.** Replace the current `spiderActive: Bool` + `spiderBlend: Float` pair with a state machine: `.idle` / `.entering(progress: Float)` / `.walking(fromIdx: Int, toIdx: Int, progress: Float)` / `.exiting(progress: Float)` / `.cooldown(remainingSegments: Int)`. State advances on each tick; `spiderBlend` becomes a derived value from the current state.
2. **Off-camera entry path.** On trigger, spawn at UV (1.10, 0.50) (or randomly chosen edge-adjacent position outside [0,1]) and walk to the first polygon vertex over ~1.5 s. `.entering` state.
3. **Walking path along polygon hooks.** Use `bs.anchors[]` (V.7.7C.3 polygon vertices) as waypoints. Spider visits 2–3 polygon vertices over 10–15 seconds, walking along silk thread paths (frame edges). Per-waypoint duration ~4–6 s. Body position interpolates smoothly along the silk edge between consecutive waypoints (catmull-rom or simple linear; spec TBD). Existing leg gait drives leg tips relative to body — animates naturally as body translates.
4. **Min-visibility latch.** Once activated, spider stays visible for at least 12–15 seconds regardless of trigger condition. Replace the current `if spiderActive && !conditionMet { spiderActive = false }` with a min-visibility timer that holds. After expiry, transition to `.exiting` and walk off-frame.
5. **N-segment cooldown for rarity.** Currently per-segment cooldown via `spiderFiredInSegment`. Expand to "spider may fire AT MOST once every N segments". Default N=3; configurable. New `ArachneState.spidersFiredCount: Int` increments on each `_reset()`; trigger gates on `spidersFiredCount % N == 0` AND `!spiderFiredInSegment`.
6. **GPU contract.** `ArachneSpiderGPU` stays at 80 bytes (V.7.7D contract). Body position writes to existing `posX` / `posY` fields each frame. Heading writes to `heading` (rotates as spider walks turn corners). No struct expansion.
7. **Pause-guard interaction.** While spider is active, the build state machine is paused (V.7.7C.2 contract). Spider movement progresses independently — body translates and gait animates regardless of build pause.
8. **Music coupling (TBD):** does the spider walking pace couple to music (slower on quiet passages, faster on dense tracks), or is it on a fixed wallclock? Decide at implementation. D-095 audio-modulated TIME precedent suggests `pace = 1.0 + 0.18 × midAttRel` keeps it consistent with the build state machine.

**Done when:**

- Spider state machine implemented with all five states (`.idle` / `.entering` / `.walking` / `.exiting` / `.cooldown`).
- Spider visibly walks from off-camera into the frame on bass-drop trigger.
- Spider visits 2–3 polygon vertices over 10–15 seconds, walking along silk edges.
- Spider remains in view for at least 12–15 seconds regardless of trigger condition.
- Spider trigger fires AT MOST once every N segments (default N=3).
- Existing per-segment cooldown (`spiderFiredInSegment`) preserved as a same-segment fallback.
- All targeted suites pass.
- Goldens regenerated (substantial drift expected — spider position now varies across the 10–15 s walk).
- 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files.
- New `ArachneSpiderMovementTests` test suite covering the five-state machine transitions, min-visibility latch, N-segment cooldown.
- D-100 (or next-available) decision in `docs/DECISIONS.md` documenting the architectural choices above.
- Manual smoke confirms all four behaviours: off-camera entry, walking along web, min-visibility hold, rarity (one trigger per N=3 segments).

**Verify:** Build → `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` → targeted suites pre-golden → visual harness sanity check (force spider via `forceActivateForTest(at:)` and capture the walk path) → golden hash regen → targeted suites post-golden → full engine + app suites → SwiftLint → manual smoke (Matt watches multiple spider triggers across a full session, confirms walking path looks natural, min-visibility holds, rarity gate enforces N-segment cooldown).

**Estimated sessions:** 2–3 (state machine + waypoint navigation + min-visibility + rarity + tests + golden regen).

**Carry-forward:** V.7.10 cert review — final QA pass.

---

### Increment V.8.0-spec — Arachne3D: parallel-preset commit + four pushbacks ✅ 2026-05-08 (D-096)

**Scope.** Doc-only spec validation session against four pushbacks (perf budget honesty, screen-space refraction artifact, chromatic dispersion, parallel-preset feasibility). No code changed. Establishes the architectural commitments for V.8.1 onward: parallel preset (`Arachne3D` alongside V.7.7D `Arachne`), sampled WORLD backdrop, screen-space refraction with documented edge artifact, chromatic dispersion in V.8.2 (silhouette-band approach), Tier-1 mitigations (noSSGI default + capped drops + half-res lighting). System-wide reframe ("same visual conversation, not pixel-match") adopted as cert principle for the full preset ladder.

**Done when:** ✅ All five doc files updated (`ARACHNE_3D_DESIGN.md`, `ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md`, `VISUAL_REFERENCES/arachne/Arachne_Rendering_Architecture_Contract.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`); ✅ `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` passes (no behavioral change); ✅ `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp build` green; ✅ 0 new SwiftLint violations; ✅ `git diff --stat` shows only doc files changed; ✅ D-096 filed.

**Carry-forward:** V.8.1 below.

---

### Increment V.8.1 — Arachne3D minimal end-to-end 3D scaffold

**Prerequisite:** V.8.0-spec ✅ 2026-05-08 (D-096).

**Scope.** Stand up `Arachne3D` as a parallel preset alongside V.7.7D `Arachne` per D-096 Decision 1. New `Arachne3D.metal` + `Arachne3D.json` (display name `"Arachne 3D"`, `certified: false`, default `rubric_profile`) under `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/`. `passes: ["ray_march", "post_process"]` (drop `["staged"]`); WORLD pass continues to ship via the existing V.7.7B `arachne_world_fragment` writing `arachneWorldTex` (bound at the same texture index Arachne uses today). The ray-march pass implements `sceneSDF` / `sceneMaterial` using the V.2 SDF tree (`sd_capsule`, `sd_sphere`, `op_smooth_union`) for a **single static web** at `(0, 0, 0)`: 12 procedurally-unrolled spokes, one spiral revolution, no chord-segment subdivision, no drops, no spider, no build cycle. Material: `mat_silk_thread` (V.3 cookbook) on silk strands. Lighting: directional key + flat ambient; **no IBL, no SSGI** (`noSSGI` is the Tier-1 default per D-096 Decision 5). Camera: static, framed on the hub, FoV ~50°. `ArachneState` reused unchanged from V.7.7D — Arachne3D binds the same instance; existing 2D Arachne preset continues to render in parallel. **No `Arachne3DState` is introduced.** Layout audit on `WebGPU` to confirm a `hubZ: Float` extension fits in the existing 80-byte slot (purely additive — V.7.7D Arachne ignores the new field).

Out of scope for V.8.1: drops (V.8.2), refraction (V.8.2), chromatic dispersion (V.8.2), spider (V.8.3), IBL cubemap + DoF (V.8.4), multi-web pool + cinematic camera + foreground build state machine (V.8.5), cert (V.8.6).

**Done when (D-096 Decision 8 — single structural acceptance gate):**

1. **Single web visibly rendering through the deferred PBR pipeline at the correct screen position.** Manual verify by launching the app, cycling to Arachne3D via `⌘[` / `⌘]`, and confirming the silk-strand web renders at the framed hub.
2. **Camera parallax visible.** A small (≤0.5 unit) camera offset injected via developer-shortcut or test fixture must produce visible 3D parallax of silk strands against the WORLD backdrop. The strands move relative to the backdrop; the backdrop does not move (it's a billboard sample per D-096 Decision 2). This proves real 3D rendering, not a 2D fragment shader simulating depth.
3. **WORLD pass sampled correctly as backdrop.** Miss-ray pixels return `arachneWorldTex.sample(uv)` (not flat color, not the sky-only V.7.7B early-out). Verified by silencing the silk SDF in a debug build and confirming the full-frame WORLD render reads through.
4. **Anti-reference visual rejection.** Rendered frame must NOT visually match `09_anti_clipart_symmetry.jpg` or `10_anti_neon_stylized_glow.jpg`. Operationally — until automated dHash-against-anti-refs lands — Matt eyeballs the V.8.1 contact sheet against both anti-refs at the phase boundary and signs off.
5. **p95 frame time inside the budget forecast committed in D-096 Decision 5.** Single-web V.8.1 scene is a fraction of the V.8.5 forecast; Tier 2 expected ~3–5 ms p95, Tier 1 expected ~5–8 ms p95 with the noSSGI default engaged. **V.8.1's first task is to instrument the scene with `MTLCounterSet.timestampGPU` and validate per-component costs against the §4.4 forecast on a real Tier 1 (M1 or M2) device + a real Tier 2 (M3) device.** If Tier 1 exceeds 14 ms p95 even at this reduced scene complexity, the architecture is wrong for Tier 1 and V.8.x replans before V.8.2.
6. **`PresetVisualReviewTests` extended to render `Arachne3D`** alongside `Arachne` for silence / steady / beat-heavy / sustained-bass fixtures into the harness contact sheet under `RENDER_VISUAL=1`. Net-new `Arachne3D` golden hashes added to `goldenPresetHashes` in `PresetRegressionTests`; existing Arachne hashes stay locked at V.7.7D values per D-096 Decision 1.
7. **Visual feedback loop engaged at phase boundary** per `ARACHNE_3D_DESIGN.md §7.3`. Claude Code renders the contact sheet, summarises what changed structurally, and stops. Matt + a separate Claude.ai session produce the visual diff that feeds V.8.2.
8. **Targeted suites pass:** `PresetAcceptance` (Arachne3D added to the parametrized list), `PresetRegression` (Arachne3D goldens), `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` (preset count 14 → 15, no silent compile drop per Failed Approach #44), the existing Arachne suites unchanged. 0 new SwiftLint violations.
9. **Closeout report** per CLAUDE.md Increment Completion Protocol: files changed, tests run, harness output paths, doc updates (V.8.1 entry flipped to ✅; D-096 referenced as the architectural source), capability registry updates if any, known risks (anti-reference subjective check pending automated dHash; perf forecast unverified on Tier 1 hardware until Matt runs the harness on M1/M2), git status clean.

**Verify:**
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build` green.
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` green; `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetVisualReview` produces non-placeholder Arachne3D PNGs alongside Arachne PNGs.
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml` 0 violations on touched files.
- `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetVisualReview` writes Arachne3D contact-sheet PNGs to `/tmp/phosphene_visual/<ISO8601>/`.
- Manual: launch app, cycle to Arachne3D, verify acceptance criteria 1–4 above.

**Estimated sessions:** 1 (scaffold-only).

**Carry-forward:** V.8.2 — drops at chord-segment intersections (Tier 2: ~300–500/web; Tier 1: capped at 150/web per D-096 Decision 5) + screen-space Snell's-law refraction sampling `arachneWorldTex` + silhouette-band chromatic dispersion. V.8.3 — spider in 3D via `sceneSDF` (V.7.7D `sd_spider_combined` adapted) + chitin material via `sceneMaterial`. V.8.4 — IBL forest cubemap from V.7.7B WORLD palette + depth-of-field on `PostProcessChain`. V.8.5 — multi-web pool in 3D + cinematic camera (Decision E.3) + foreground build state machine + 3D vibration. V.8.6 — M7 cert + V.7.7D Arachne retirement (file deletion + `Arachne 3D` → `Arachne` rename in JSON sidecar).

**V.8.2+ scope is intentionally NOT expanded yet.** Each subsequent increment gets its own ENGINEERING_PLAN entry once V.8.1 contact-sheet review lands and the visual feedback loop produces the diff that informs V.8.2's prompt.

---

### Increment V.7.7 — Arachne v8: WORLD pillar + 1–2 background dewy webs

**Status correction (2026-05-07):** The `[V.7.7 redo]` commit (`fa5dacdf`, 2026-05-05 10:54) added the six-layer inline `drawWorld()` and frame threads to the *monolithic* `arachne_fragment`. Three hours later, `[V.7.7A]` (`ccefe065`, 2026-05-05 14:13) retired that fragment and shipped placeholder staged stubs. The V.7.7 work is therefore preserved as dead reference code in `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Arachne.metal` (free-function `drawWorld` ~line 142, legacy `arachne_fragment` ~line 617), not in the dispatched path. Promotion into the staged path is V.7.7B.

**Prerequisite:** V.7.7A staged-composition scaffold migration ✅ 2026-05-05.

**Scope:** Per `ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md §4` (full WORLD pillar) + §5.12 (background webs) + §8.1 step 1–2 (render-pass layout). The 2026-05-03 spec rewrite expanded V.7.7 from a thin atmosphere pass into the full layered WORLD — implementing §4.2's six depth layers into a half-res `arachneWorldTex`: sky band (4.2.1) + distant tree silhouettes (4.2.2) + mid-distance trees with bark detail (4.2.3) + near-frame anchor branches (4.2.4) + forest floor (4.2.5) + volumetric atmosphere (4.2.6 fog + light shafts + dust motes). Mood-driven palette per §4.3 (preserved verbatim from V.7.6.C-locked recipe — `topCol`/`botCol`/`beamCol` + per-layer color application table). Includes 5s low-pass `smoothedValence`/`smoothedArousal` state per §4.3. Then 1–2 pre-populated background dewy webs (§5.12) with refractive drops sampling `arachneWorldTex` per the §5.8 recipe (Snell's law, eta ≈ 0.752, fresnel rim, specular pinpoint, dark edge ring). Background webs vibrate per §8.2. Foreground unchanged (still V.7.5 build code — refactored in V.7.8).

**Done when:**
- WORLD reads as a forest with depth — six layers individually identifiable. Side-by-side via harness contact sheet against refs `06` / `15` / `16` / `17` / `18` / `07`.
- Background webs read as photorealistic dewdrops side-by-side with refs `01` / `03` / `04` via the harness contact sheet.
- Pure-black silence anchor preserved (§8.3) — `(satScale × valScale) < 0.05` clears WORLD pass to black.
- All test suites pass; 0 SwiftLint violations.
- p95 frame time at 1080p ≤ 6.0 ms Tier 2 / ≤ 7.5 ms Tier 1.
- Matt runtime visual review of the WORLD + background-webs state passes.

**Verify:** Same as V.7.6.1 + Matt runtime review.

**Estimated sessions:** 3.

### Increment V.7.8 — Arachne v8: WEB pillar — foreground build refactor (corrected biology) [Subsumed by V.7.7C.2 — see V.7.7C.2 section above]

**Status correction (2026-05-07):** The `[V.7.8]` commit (`3536a023`, 2026-05-05 11:06) added the chord-segment capture spiral to `arachneEvalWeb()` inside the monolithic fragment. Same retirement story as V.7.7 — code survives as dead reference at ~line 265 of `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Arachne.metal`; port to staged dispatch is V.7.7B. The chord-segment SDF replacement for the degenerate Archimedean curve (Failed Approach #34) is a permanent reference for V.7.7B; do not regress to circular rings.

**Status (2026-05-09 / D-095):** This V.7.5-era line item is **obsolete** — V.7.7C.2 implements the single-foreground build state machine (frame → radials → INWARD spiral → settle, audio-modulated TIME pacing, per-segment spider cooldown, build pause/resume on spider). See V.7.7C.2 above for the actual closeout.

**Scope:** Per `ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md §5.1–§5.11` (WEB pillar in full). Replace V.7.5 pool-of-webs system with single-foreground-build state machine implementing the corrected orb-weaver biology: frame polygon (§5.3, 4–7 anchors on near-frame branches from V.7.7) → hub (§5.4, dense knot, NOT concentric rings) → radials (§5.5, 12–17, alternating-pair order, ±20% jitter, drawn one at a time over ~1.5s each) → **capture spiral winding INWARD** (§5.6, chord-segment SDF from outer frame to hub — corrects the 2026-05-02 spec error which had the spiral winding outward) → settle (§5.2, completion signal at 60s ceiling). Sag per §5.7 (`kSag ∈ [0.10, 0.18]`, drop weight modifies sag). Drops per §5.8 with accretion over time on just-laid spiral chords (foreground starts sparse, grows dense; background webs stay saturated). Anchor terminations per §5.9 — small adhesive blobs where outer frame threads meet near-frame branches. Silk material per §5.10 (minor finishing — Marschner-lite removed). Pause on spider trigger; resume on spider fade. Foreground completion emits `presetCompletionEvent` via the V.7.6.2 channel.

**Done when:**
- Visual review via harness: foreground build is visibly progressing — radials extend one-at-a-time, spiral winds **inward** chord-by-chord, completion fires at ≤ 60s under typical music.
- Drops are the visual hero — viewer's eye lands on drops first, threads second. Drops show refraction + fresnel rim + specular pinpoint + dark edge ring per §5.8.
- Anchor structure reads as solid — frame polygon visibly meets near-frame branches at adhesive blobs. Side-by-side with ref `11`. Polygon is irregular, not circular.
- Spider trigger visibly pauses construction; spider fade visibly resumes from paused accumulator (does not restart).
- Orchestrator transitions on completion event when `minDuration` satisfied.
- All test suites pass; 0 SwiftLint violations.
- p95 frame time ≤ 6.0 ms Tier 2.
- Matt runtime visual review passes.

**Verify:** Same.

**Estimated sessions:** 3.

### Increment V.7.9 — Arachne v8: SPIDER pillar deepening + whole-scene vibration + cert [Subsumed by V.7.7C.2 / V.7.7D — see V.7.7C.2 + V.7.7D sections above]

**Status correction (2026-05-07):** The `[V.7.9 ✅]` commit (`97f42220`) was a CLAUDE.md status update only — 4 line changes, no shader code. The biology-correct frame → radial → spiral build order remains unimplemented in the dispatched path. SPIDER pillar deepening, vibration, and cert review remain unimplemented as well. Build-order work is scheduled for V.7.7C; SPIDER + vibration for V.7.7D; cert review for V.7.10.

**Status (2026-05-09 / D-095):** This V.7.5-era line item is **obsolete** — V.7.7D shipped SPIDER pillar deepening (3D SDF anatomy + chitin material + listening pose) + whole-scene 12 Hz vibration; V.7.7C.2 closed the structural gap (build state machine). Cert review (M7) remains scheduled for V.7.10. See V.7.7D and V.7.7C.2 above for the actual closeout.

**Scope:** Per `ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md §6` (full SPIDER pillar) + §8.2 (vibration model) + §12 (acceptance criteria). The 2026-05-03 spec rewrite expanded V.7.9 from "polish + vibration" into a full spider-anatomy refactor — V.7.5's "dark silhouette + warm rim" was the right *direction* but wrong *depth* for an easter egg that earns its rare appearance. Implements §6.1 anatomy (cephalothorax + abdomen + petiole, 8 articulated legs with outward-bending knee IK, eye cluster as 6–8 small dots in tight forward arrangement — refs `12` + `13`, NOT the jumping-spider 2x2 of ref `19`), §6.2 material (chitin base + thin-film iridescence at biological strength + Oren-Nayar-like hair fuzz + per-eye specular per ref `19` technique), §6.3 pose / gait / listening pose (resting at hub by default; listening pose — front legs raised ~30° — fires on sustained low-attack-ratio bass for ≥ 1.5s), §6.4 lighting (deep body shadow + warm-amber rim + eye sparkle), §6.5 trigger and behavior (per-segment cooldown replaces V.7.5's 300s session-level lock). Whole-scene tremor on bass per §8.2 — 12 Hz audio-rate vibration applied per-vertex to all webs + near-frame branches + spider, amplitude driven by `max(f.subBass_dev, f.bass_dev)` + per-kick spike from `f.beatBass`. Forest floor and distant layers don't shake. Final tuning of drop counts, brightness, sag magnitude, free-zone size, mood-smoothing window against references via the harness. Cert review.

**Done when:**
- Visual review via harness contact sheet matches all 10 acceptance criteria from `ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md §12`.
- Spider, when present, is detailed — viewer can see cephalothorax, abdomen, 8 legs with visible knee bends, eye cluster, abdominal pattern. Material reads as biological iridescent chitin (ref `14`), not neon (ref `10`). Listening pose visibly fires on sustained bass.
- Web vibration visible during heavy bass — whole-scene tremor (~12 Hz) on background + foreground webs + branches + spider; ground/distant layers stable.
- Anti-refs `09` (clipart symmetry) and `10` (neon glow) explicitly NOT matched. Refs `01`, `03`, `04`, `05`, `06`, `08`, `11`, `12`, `15`, `16` cited as reachable.
- All test suites pass; 0 SwiftLint violations.
- p95 frame time ≤ 6.0 ms Tier 2.
- **Matt cert review.** If positive: `Arachne.json` `certified: true`, add `"Arachne"` back to `FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets`, mark V.5 references action complete, log M7 outcome in references README.

**Verify:** Same.

**Estimated sessions:** 2.

**V.8 remains reserved for Gossamer** per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.2`.

### Increment V.8 — Gossamer v4

**Scope:** Apply to Gossamer per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.2`. Physical wave displacement (waves offset silk strand positions, not just tint them); silk Marschner-lite material tuned for hero resonator; fine specular glints at thread intersections; chromatic aberration on wave peaks; inward/outward dust drift; SSGI-lit background from web emission.

**Done when:** same rubric gates as V.7; `certified: true`.

**Verify:** same as V.7.

**Estimated sessions:** 2 (physical displacement rework / atmosphere + chromatic aberration).

### Increment V.9 — Ferrofluid Ocean v2 (redirect) ✅ (certified 2026-05-18)

**Status:** **Certified.** `FerrofluidOcean.json` `certified: true` flipped in commit `ab3156a2` (round 69, 2026-05-18) after Matt M7-approved the round-65 build against the curated reference set. The Increment V.9 arc spans Sessions 1 → 4.5c (rounds 1–69 across the V.9 Session 4.5c phase). Estimated 5 sessions; actual 4 sessions plus a 4.5-tagged rescue phase covering 69 rounds. The V.9 redirect (D-124, 2026-05-13) and the matID==2 mirror-reflects-sky paradigm pivot (D-126, 2026-05-14) and the inline-aurora-from-FeatureVector path (D-127, 2026-05-14) are all permanently landed.

**Session 1 ✅ (2026-05-13).** Macro layer landed: Gerstner-wave swell (4 superposed waves, arousal-baseline + drums_energy_dev accent) composed with Rosensweig spike-field SDF (§4.6 voronoi_f1f2 + fbm8 jitter, bass_energy_dev → spike height). Independence contract (D-124(d)) verified — calm-body-with-spikes vs agitated-body-without-spikes produce distinct frames. Glass-dish v1 baseline retired wholesale; FerrofluidOceanDiagnosticTests deleted; FerrofluidOceanVisualTests rewritten minimal (shader-compile + 4-fixture render + independence demo). Golden hash commented out (regen at Session 5). MaxDuration reference updated 49 → 55 s for new motion_intensity/visual_density. Skip-guards added to FerrofluidBeatSyncTests / FerrofluidLiveAudioTests / PresetAcceptanceTests where the PostProcessChain-direct path or band-energy assumptions no longer apply (rewrite scheduled for Session 5). Sessions 2–5 carry-forward summaries unchanged from FERROFLUID_OCEAN_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPTS.md.

**Session 2 ✅ (2026-05-13).** Material + atmosphere layer landed: new `matID == 3` "metallic thin-film Cook-Torrance" branch in `RayMarch.metal` `raymarch_lighting_fragment` — F0 sourced from a renderer-private `rm_thinfilm_rgb` helper (220 nm film thickness, IOR 1.45 over IOR-1.0 metallic substrate, wavelength-sampled RGB approximation per Belcour & Barla 2017). Direct light, IBL ambient floor, and fog colour all multiplied by `scene.lightColor.rgb` so D-022 mood tinting propagates scene-wide. `FerrofluidOcean.metal` `sceneMaterial` now emits `outMatID = 3`; JSON sidecar widens `scene_far_plane` to 40 m and `scene_fog` to 0.04 for the ocean-portion expanse. `rm_brdf_with_F0` helper added adjacent to existing `rm_brdf` for caller-supplied F0; existing presets (`matID == 0`) untouched. New `testFerrofluidOceanMoodTintAtmosphereShifts` gate asserts cool-valence vs warm-valence renders produce avg channel diff > 1.0 (observed ~31 with fogNear=0 test override; details below). Carry-forward to Sessions 3–5 unchanged. Engine suite: 1226 pass / 1 known pre-existing flake (`MemoryReporter.residentBytes`); the three Session-1 skip-guards still in place.

**Carry-forward note re: fogNear default.** Resolved by P2-B follow-up (same day): `scene_fog_near` JSON field added to `PresetDescriptor`, default 20.0 (matches prior `SceneUniforms()` hard-coded value so existing presets stay byte-identical — Glass Brutalist + Kinetic Sculpture golden hashes regenerate to the same values). Ferrofluid Ocean sets `"scene_fog_near": 0.0` so the visible 4–14 m surface enters the fog band in production. The mood-tint test's manual `sceneParamsB.x = 0` override was retired in favour of the JSON-side configuration.

**Session 4 ⚠ (2026-05-13 — shipped, M7 review FAILED).** Phase 0 + Phase A + Phase B landed and passed every automated gate, but the M7 review of the live session capture (`/Users/braesidebandit/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-14T01-20-28Z/video.mp4`) revealed four structural failures: (1) no reflective-black ferrofluid material visible — surface reads as gray wet concrete; (2) Cassie-Baxter droplets are foreign and have no load-bearing musical role (Failed Approach #58 at layer scope); (3) the §5.8 stage rig as 4 physical point lights with inverse-square falloff produces ~0.02× attenuation at the spec orbit distance — beams have no visual presence; (4) effects compete rather than work in harmony. Root cause: implementing "moving colored beams reflected on the ferrofluid surface" as discrete point lights is the wrong paradigm. The references show mirror-reflects-aurora-sky (`08_lighting_aurora_over_dark_water.jpg` annotation: "the preset's beams are *continuous diffuse gradients, not point sources with pillar reflections*"). The gray wash is the IBL cubemap (`rm_skyColor` — near-white horizon gradient) reflected by the mirror, not "ambient drowning beams." Also contributing: Phase A's micro-normal perturbation destroyed the mirror identity by jittering specular; meso warp + droplets added decoration without articulating musical role. The mid-session sanity check claim "no structural divergence observed" was retroactively wrong — self-judging "looks reasonable" did not catch what side-by-side reference comparison would have. Lesson: read `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/ferrofluid_ocean/README.md` BEFORE authoring any preset session; cite specific reference image traits in design comments. Session 4 commits (P0 + PA + PB) remain in git history; **Session 4.5 is the rescue**. See `docs/presets/FERROFLUID_OCEAN_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPTS.md` for the rescue prompt (authored 2026-05-13).

**Session 4 (full landed-work record).** V.9 Phase 0 + Phase A + Phase B material detail layers landed. **Phase 0** (4 commits, P0 prefix) — Session 3 follow-ups: 11 `StageRigDecoderTests` (light_count clamp + palette_phase_offsets length adjustments + Codable round-trip), 8 `FerrofluidStageRigMathTests` (silence convergence to `floor × baseline`, 150 ms smoother discrete-time α=dt/τ step response, pitch-shift confidence boundary, otherEnergyDev × 0.15 fallback scale, arousal-driven orbit phase advance), silence-state matID == 2 visual snapshot now binds a real `FerrofluidStageRig` and asserts avg channel > 8.0 in `testFerrofluidOceanRendersFourFixtures`, `Scripts/check_drums_beat_intensity.sh` CI grep gate bans `drumsBeat` from stage-rig intensity scope (`Sources/Presets/FerrofluidOcean/*`, `Sources/Shared/StageRigState.swift`, `Sources/Presets/*StageRig*.swift`, matID == 2 branch of `RayMarch.metal`), `intensitySmoothingTauMs ≤ 0` warn-and-floor in `PresetDescriptor.StageRig` decoder, even palette-offset pad fix (decoder cached `originalCount` before append loop — prior formula gave [in0, in1, 0.5, 1.0] instead of intended [in0, in1, 0.5, 0.75]), `FerrofluidStageRig.reset()` doc-comment notes test-only status. **Phase A** (3 commits, PA prefix) — JSON schema + material detail: new `PresetDescriptor.FerrofluidParams` struct (`meso_strength` / `droplet_strength` / `micro_normal_amplitude` / `thin_film_thickness_baseline_nm` / `thin_film_arousal_range_nm`) with negative-value warn-and-floor, 7 `FerrofluidParamsDecoderTests` (full / empty / missing / partial / negative / round-trip / on-disk back-fill), production `FerrofluidOcean.json` ferrofluid block added; new MSL utilities `fo_meso_warp` (2-component 2-octave `fbm4` at scale 2.0, amplitude 0.15) and `fo_droplet_sdf` (hemispherical SDF beads per Voronoi cell, radius 0.04, sits proud of spike apex by 0.6 × radius) composed into `sceneSDF` via `op_smooth_union(surfaceSdf, dropletSdf, 0.04)`; new micro-normal perturbation in `raymarch_lighting_fragment` matID == 2 branch via 3 `noiseFBM` samples at scale 15 derived as gradient, amplitude 0.02 — never audio-modulated per §5.8 silence-state semantics. **Phase B** (2 commits, PB prefix) — D-026 deviation-primitive audio routing: `fo_meso_strength(f) = clamp(0.5 + 1.5 × max(0, f.mid_att_rel), 0, 2)` (baseline 0.5 silence-state turbulence, never zero), `fo_droplet_strength(f) = clamp(0.0 + 2.0 × max(0, f.bass_att_rel), 0, 2)` (zero beads at silence per `10_silence_calm_body.jpg`), thin-film thickness `220 nm + arousal × 40 nm` → effective [180, 260] nm in subtle blue-to-cyan band (rainbow oil-slick failure mode > ~300 nm). Both matID == 2 and matID == 3 branches updated so a future preset adopting the single-light fallback path inherits the audio-modulated iridescence. Audio data hierarchy compliance: only `mid_att_rel` / `bass_att_rel` / `arousal` (D-026 deviation primitives / smoothed scalars); no `*_beat` / no raw AGC arithmetic; `check_drums_beat_intensity.sh` + `check_sample_rate_literals.sh` both pass post-commit. Visual harness output: Phase A + Phase B contact sheets at `/var/folders/.../PhospheneFerrofluidOceanV9Session1/{fixtures,mood_tint}/`. Engine suite: 1256 tests pass / 0 failures. Preset count remains 15 (Failed Approach #44 silent-drop gate passes); PresetRegressionTests pass; all 6 `FerrofluidOceanVisualTests` pass (incl. matID == 2 dispatch active, mood-tint atmosphere/IBL). SwiftLint strict clean on touched files; pre-existing `BeatThisPreprocessor.swift` baseline violations from DSP.2 S2 unchanged. Carry-forward to Session 5: production tuning of `intensity_baseline` / `orbit_altitude` / `orbit_radius` against the references (Failed Approach #49 — tuning happens against the references, not in the abstract), golden-hash regen for Ferrofluid Ocean in `PresetRegressionTests`, single-shadow-light hack only if M7 cert review reveals a shadow-lift gap, rewrite of `FerrofluidBeatSyncTests` / `FerrofluidLiveAudioTests` / `PresetAcceptanceTests` (skip-guards still in place from Session 1), M7 cert review against `04_specular_razor_highlights.jpg` + `01_macro_ferrofluid_at_swell_scale.jpg`.

**Session 4.5c Phase 1 ✅ (2026-05-14 → 2026-05-15, 18 commits + 1 docs commit).** Architectural rebuild of Ferrofluid Ocean — port from SDF ray-march + audio-reactive aurora curtain → tessellated mesh + vertex displacement + Leitl four-layer fluid-shading material + procedural studio env. Visual baseline at end of phase: discrete pointed pyramidal spikes on a pitch-black substrate, audio-coupled spike height via `stems.bass_energy × 1.5 + bass_energy_dev × 0.5` (round 15 calibration after `2026-05-15T14-10-12Z` revealed round-14's peaks were wire-thin), camera at ocean framing (~18° down, FOV 55°). Round-by-round breakdown: rounds 1-3 retire D-127 stage rig + introduce direct audio→aurora routing + post-Billie-Jean tuning; rounds 4-5 pin particles + sharpen bake + narrow radius; rounds 6-11 port Leitl fragment shader, swap IBL corridor for procedural studio env, fix fresnel coord adaptation (N.z → dot(N,V)), drop snowman silhouette via linear cone, lower camera 42° → 18°, reduce particle count 6000 → 1520 for fewer/bigger spikes; **round 12 (Failed Approach #65 admission — only fragment shader was ported, not geometry pipeline) pivots to mesh + vertex displacement** — the moment Matt's "much better, foundation works" lands; rounds 13-15 are post-mesh polish (tilt-gated iridescence for pitch-black substrate, raw-bass-amplitude baseline for irregular-track response, spike-height calibration after observed `stems.bass_energy` peaks at 2.58 not the assumed 1.0). **Phase 1 visual completion continues in the round 16-32 entry below.**

**Session 4.5c Phase 1 visual completion ✅ (2026-05-15, rounds 16-32, 19 commits).** Substrate calibration → wave motion → aurora reflection arc. Picks up from round 15 (wire-thin spike peaks regressed) and lands on a visual baseline where Matt declares "we're close" pending the camera-angle change. **Round 16:** sqrt-scale spike strength base + bump coefficient `1.5 → 2.5` after `2026-05-15T14-22-14Z` capture showed round-15's linear baseline collapsed (p50 aspect 0.5:1, almost flat) — Money peaks preserved at ~7.7:1, typical music reads as visible spikes. **Round 17 (density):** particle count `1520 → 3025` (55 × 55 isotropic grid), spike base radius `0.12 → 0.17` so bases nearly touch — area coverage `17% → 75%`, matches reference set's dense lattice character. **Round 18 (shape):** linear cone `max(0, 1 - r/R)` → squared cone `(max(0, 1 - r/R))²` — sharp pointed tips with concave-curved sides, smooth substrate flare. Matt-approved "stocky pyramidal ferrofluid character" per `01_macro_*` / `02_meso_*` / `04_specular_*`. Round 9's "squared = snowman" finding rejected at sparse-particle density was not the math itself but the sparse-density × squared combination — at round-17 density the squared profile produces ferrofluid, not snowmen. **Rounds 19-26 (wave motion arc):** R19 introduces Gerstner waves (4 superposed, amplitudes summing 0.30 wu, wall-clock phase rate); R20 design pivot — spike audio coupling deprecated (waves become the dominant motion, spike strength becomes constant `kFerrofluidSpikeStrength = 2.0`), wave phase tempo-coupled via new `MeshUniforms.tempoScale = bpm/60` (CPU-passed live from `mirPipeline.liveDriftTracker.currentBPM`), per-wave `beatsPerCycle` 2/3/2/4 polyrhythmic; R21 collapse polyrhythm to single bar-locked rate (Matt: "fires on the first beat of a new bar, so once per bar"); R22 drop drum amplitude pump (was 0.5 × drums_dev) — drum hits visually obscured wave motion; R23 drop arousal coupling (mood-classifier startup transient produced sudden amplitude drop at every song start); R24 swap `accumulated_audio_time` → `features.time` after diagnosing the 20-30s AGC-settling jerk as the energy-weighted accumulator at `_accumulatedAudioTime += max(0, energy) × deltaTime`; R25 + R26 add metadata-driven meter override (`PartialTrackProfile.timeSignature` + `PreFetchedTrackProfile.timeSignature` + `BeatGrid.overridingBeatsPerBar(_:)` + `LiveBeatDriftTracker.overrideBeatsPerBar(_:)` runtime path + prep-aware path via `SessionPreparer.metadataFetcher` and `analyzePreview` parameter), plus `kGerstnerBarsPerCycle = 6.0` so Love Rehab cycles every 12 s and Money would cycle every 20.5 s if Soundcharts populated `time_signature`. **Rounds 27-32 (aurora-as-reflection arc):** R27 wires `rm_ferrofluidSky` into Layer 2 ambient of `fluid_shading` (was `fluid_studio_env` monochrome) — substrate now mirror-reflects D-126 aurora content at Rview; R28 6.3× brighter aurora (baseline 0.13 → 0.40, modulation 0.22 → 0.50, ambient weight 0.20 → 0.70) after Matt: "muted ... I'd like the aurora to be highly intense, emitting almost neon"; R29 env-tinted specular (wrong direction — produced green/yellow tip highlights against the references' white tips); R30 reverts R29's specular tint + moves curtain elevation `0.83 → 0.0` (horizon — so spike sides catch the curtain instead of flat substrate catching it) + ambient `1.0 → 0.3` (kills purple-substrate-between bleed); R31 specular weight `1.2 → 0.0` (Matt: "I don't want bright white specular at spike tips ... only source of color be from the aurora curtains") + palette replaced with aurora-realistic 3-stop (pink/green/purple per Matt's atmospheric-chemistry infographic, was IQ cosine producing arbitrary hues); R32 palette base phase `0.82 → 0.50` (green at t=0.33 was mathematically unreachable from the legacy 0.82 base) + fresnel weight `0.3 → 0.0` (cyan-tinted white at grazing angles = "gray at peak tops" per Matt). **End-of-session calibration:** spike strength constant 2.0 (no per-frame audio coupling); 6 bars/cycle Gerstner waves at amplitudes summing 0.60 wu, presenceGate × 0.85 amplitudeMul; aurora curtain at horizon (elevation 0.0, thickness 0.35, azimuth wedge 0.30/0.75), intensity 1.0 baseline + 1.5 × drums_smoothed, palette base 0.50 ± vocals-pitch/valence (±0.20) ± slow orbital drift (±0.10), three primaries pink (1.00, 0.20, 0.55) / green (0.10, 1.00, 0.30) / purple (0.45, 0.10, 1.00); Layer composition `ambient × 0.3 + iridescence` only (specular and fresnel both zero). **Files changed across the 19 commits (deduplicated):** `Renderer/Shaders/FerrofluidMesh.metal`, `Renderer/Shaders/RayMarch.metal`, `Renderer/Shaders/FerrofluidParticles.metal`, `Presets/FerrofluidOcean/FerrofluidParticles.swift`, `Presets/FerrofluidOcean/FerrofluidParticles+InitialPositions.swift`, `Presets/FerrofluidOcean/FerrofluidMesh.swift`, `Presets/Shaders/FerrofluidOcean.metal`, `Session/SessionPreparer.swift`, `Session/SessionPreparer+Analysis.swift`, `DSP/BeatGrid.swift`, `DSP/LiveBeatDriftTracker.swift`, `Audio/Protocols.swift`, `Audio/MetadataPreFetcher.swift`, `Audio/SoundchartsFetcher.swift`, `Shared/AudioFeatures+Metadata.swift`, `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`, `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift`, `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift`, `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift`, `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+InitHelpers.swift`, `Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/FerrofluidParticlesTests.swift`, `Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Renderer/RayMarchPipelineTests.swift`, `Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Renderer/SSGITests.swift`, `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`. **Gates:** engine + app build clean across every commit; 17-78 tests pass per round (varied set across `FerrofluidOceanVisualTests` / `ShaderLibraryTests` / `PresetRegression` / `RayMarchPipelineTests` / `SSGITests` / `MetadataPreFetcher` / `LiveBeatDriftTracker` / `FerrofluidParticlesTests` / `SessionPreparer`); 0 new SwiftLint violations on changed files (function-body-length and function-parameter-count suppressions added at `analyzePreview` and `encodeGBufferPass` with rationale comments — sequential pipeline / explicit binding-point structure). **Known issues filed:** `BUG-012` (P1) MPSGraph `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` at `StemFFTEngine.runForwardGraph()` under sustained force-dispatch — observed once at 2026-05-15T17:54Z, pre-existing latent bug, no rounds 16-32 commit touched the stem separator pipeline. `BUG-013` (P2) Soundcharts metadata source does not expose `time_signature` — verified empirically (decoder added with `CodingKeys: time_signature`, field stays nil on every track in `2026-05-15T17-54-49Z` capture); the override infrastructure is wired correctly but has no value to consume; Money keeps the ML-detected meter=2/X, wave cycles at 5.85 s/cycle instead of intended 20.5 s/cycle (visual still acceptable per Matt's review). **Reverted in-session work (recoverable from reflog ~90 days):** commits `1d7c5a8b` (round 3a vertex-stage `heightFactor` from a `FerrofluidAudioControl` smoother) + `82508a3a` (the `FerrofluidAudioControl` class itself) hard-reset before round 17 after Matt rejected the smoothed audio-control direction ("smoother killed the per-beat lock"). Three stashes (`ferrofluid-v9-recurring-files-pre-B.1` / `ferrofluid-ocean-v9-wip-pre-QR.5` / `parallel-session: L5 Arachne cleanup`) dropped per Matt's instruction — pre-redesign WIP, conflict-heavy against current HEAD. **STOP gate pending:** Matt's review of the round-32 capture, plus the carry-forward camera-angle change. Matt's 2026-05-15T18-46-51Z verdict: "We're close." **Carry-forward to next session:** (a) camera-angle change to no-sky framing (current ~18° down → ~35-45° down so the substrate fills the frame and no horizon is visible) to match the close-up framing of references `01_*` / `02_*` / `04_*` rather than the horizon-shot `08_*`; (b) re-tune reflection on spike sides after the camera move — different camera angle changes which Rview values the substrate samples, so curtain elevation 0.0 / azimuth windowing / ambient weight may need adjustment to keep spike-sides catching aurora and substrate-between staying dark in the new framing; (c) optional final-pass palette tunables (palettePhase swing ±0.20 could widen; basePhase could shift to bias toward a specific aurora primary). Brief lives at `docs/presets/FERROFLUID_OCEAN_CAMERA_REFLECTION_PROMPT.md`.

**Session 4.5c Phase 1 polish + lotus arc ✅ (2026-05-15, rounds 33-49, ~23 commits incl. 6 reverts).** Mesh-path polish + camera reframing + lotus-cluster ocean experiment. Picks up from Matt's round-32 "we're close" verdict. **Rounds 33-35 (camera + mesh resolution):** R33 closer + steeper down-angle (no-sky framing eliminating horizon visibility); R34 small zoom-out (4.30 → 5.00 wu) for substrate breathing room; R35 mesh tessellation 256² → 512² verts for sharper peak silhouettes. **Rounds 36-39 (aurora curtain tuning):** R36 second curtain band at azimuth -0.35 to light spike bases (REVERTED — bottom band lit the troughs counterproductively); R37 sharpen curtain edges (thickness 0.35 → 0.10); R38 hard-edge curtain band replacing smoothstep falloff (REVERTED — too jagged); R39 normal-sampling epsilon fix 1/256 → 1/512 (REVERTED — produced shading discontinuities; re-applied at R40 with different mesh-pass interaction). **Rounds 40-44 (per-pixel normal + spike-profile recalibration):** R40 re-applies the epsilon fix that R39 reverted (interaction-dependent); R41 per-pixel normals from heightmap sampling (vs vertex normals; eliminates faceted-cone artifact); R42 Leitl-faithful linear cone profile + almostIdentity apex (replacing R18's squared cone after closer reference comparison); R43 Gerstner back into per-pixel normal for glossy substrate continuity; R44 narrow spikes + scaled apex round to match reference imagery more closely. **Rounds 45-49 (multi-cluster ocean experiment):** R45 radial cluster displacement (multi-cluster ocean — particle field organizes into radial groupings rather than uniform hex grid); R46 camera zoom out 15% (5.0 → 5.75 wu) to fit the multi-cluster layout; R47 density experiment 80×80 grid + radius 0.125 (denser clusters) (REVERTED — too dense, lost cluster definition); R48 lotus particle layout — concentric rings per cluster (REVERTED — pattern too literal/symmetric vs the references' organic non-uniformity); R49 per-cluster dome envelope (REVERTED — added artificial macro envelope on top of an already-modulated lattice). The lotus + dome experiments did not stick; the mesh-path baseline ended at R44/R45 polish + camera reframe. **Gates:** all rounds passed build + lints + applicable tests; no Failed Approach trips. **Carry-forward to Session 4.5c Phase 1 (rounds 50+):** Matt's review of the multi-cluster-ocean direction triggered a deeper architectural reconsideration that landed in round 50 (constant-field premise). The lotus/dome ideas remained available for re-evaluation as future micro-detail features, retired from the active build per Authoring Discipline "articulate the musical role before authoring" rule.

**Session 4.5c Phase 1 scoop diagnosis + audio-routing rebuild ✅ (2026-05-16 → 2026-05-18, rounds 50-65, 16 commits).** The phase that converted V.9 from "close but visibly competing rhythms + cone scoops" to a certifiable build. Three intersecting failure modes resolved across 16 rounds: (a) the *constant-field premise* (spike geometry as a permanent property of the ocean, not audio-coupled), (b) the *cone-scoop artifact* (test/prod G-buffer dispatch gap hiding an SDF Lipschitz violation behind a "clean fixture, broken live" wall), and (c) the *competing-rhythms reading* (two visual layers responding to the same audio timescale).

  **Rounds 50-55 (constant-field pivot + Refn aesthetic crush + particle silence):** R50 pivots to the *constant-field premise* — Ferrofluid Ocean's spike lattice becomes a permanent geometric property (ambient magnetic field analog); audio modulates only swell + aurora, never spike geometry. R51 widens aurora coverage (`kCurtainStripeThickness 0.35 → 0.70`, `kCurtainAzimuthFloor -0.30 → -0.70`, `kCurtainAzimuthPeak 0.30 → 0.80`) and pushes intensity toward neon (Matt: "highly intense, emitting almost neon"). R52 restores dense lattice + adds lotus-cluster height envelope. R53 crushes base sky to near-black for the Refn aesthetic (`lowSky = (0.002, 0.001, 0.004)`, `midSky = (0.020, 0.010, 0.030)`, `highSky = (0.010, 0.006, 0.018)` — saturated aurora becomes the only significant chromatic content). R54 silences Phase 2c particle motion under the constant-field premise (particles passed `.silent` audio because their motion was producing malformed-cone artifacts under load). R55 retires the lotus envelope after observing patchwork-quilt creases, drops density to 2500 particles (50×50 grid), and fixes spatial palette phase artifact (`R.y * 0.18` was tinting substrate-flat reflections toward green primary; removed for uniform palette across the sky).

  **Rounds 56-57 (cone-scoop diagnosis — test/prod parity discovery, Failed Approach #66):** R56 implements an SDF Lipschitz correction (`(p.y - surfaceY) / 4.0`) for the height-field SDF — fixtures render scoop-free for the first time. Celebrated as the fix. R57 diagnoses the structural test/prod gap: fixtures bind no mesh G-buffer encoder (SDF path), but live binds one via `pipeline.setMeshGBufferEncoder(...)` in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` (MESH path). Live had been taking the mesh dispatch the entire time the SDF Lipschitz fix landed — so the fix never reached production. Two corrections: (a) `setMeshGBufferEncoder` wire-up retired so live now uses the SDF G-buffer fragment; (b) fixture helper `renderDeferredRayMarch` gains `useMeshPath: Bool = false` parameter so future increments can explicitly test either branch. Memory note `feedback_fixture_live_parity.md` extended with the round-57 amendment; CLAUDE.md Failed Approach #66 documents the dispatch-branch-divergence failure mode (six rounds of fixture-based tuning had landed against the wrong reference).

  **Rounds 58-62 (wave motion restoration arc):** R58 restores visible Gerstner swell motion — the wave time source was reading `accumulated_audio_time` which advances at ~7-9% of wall-clock (energy-paused accumulator), giving 60-196 s effective wave periods that read as nearly static; switched to `features.time` (wall-clock monotonic). Memory note `project_accumulated_audio_time_not_clock.md` documents this distinction at the platform level. R59 ports the mesh-path Gerstner parameters (wavelengths 6/8/10/12 wu, amplitudes 0.10/0.14/0.16/0.20 summing 0.60) into the SDF path (had inherited the shallower 0.8-4.0 / 0.03-0.15 / sum 0.34 SDF defaults). R60 first attempt to re-introduce subtle music response on spike heights (`1.0 + 0.35 × bass_dev`), but at the same time leaves swell amplitude beat-coupled (`0.3 × drums_dev`) — Matt reads as "swelling and spike motion are struggling to coexist." R61 attempts to fix the competing-rhythms reading by gating the spike pulse to `bar_phase01` (downbeat-only) — fails because bar boundaries don't align musically with bass kicks (the pulse fires at musically arbitrary moments). R62 adds Tessendorf horizontal sway (crest-rolling motion via `0.3 × steepness` horizontal displacement) for deeper-ocean character.

  **Rounds 63-65 (audio routing rebuild — one primitive per visual layer, Failed Approach #67):** R63 reverts the audio-coupled spike height entirely — returns to constant spike geometry per the round-50 premise. R64 re-enables the Leitl fresnel layer at conservative weight 0.20 (was zeroed in round 31) — the round-53 crushed-sky environment now provides good contrast for fresnel-based chrome rim definition without producing the gray-tip artifact that motivated the original disable. R65 lands the final routing configuration: REMOVE the `0.3 × drums_dev` term from `fo_swell_scale` (swell becomes arousal-only, slow), THEN reactivate per-beat spike-height response via `1.0 + 0.35 × bass_energy_dev`. With only one visual layer carrying the per-beat signal, the spike pulse reads as intended response without competing motion. The one-primitive-per-visual-layer principle is generalized to a Phosphene architectural rule (CLAUDE.md Failed Approach #67, memory note `feedback_audio_layer_one_primitive.md`, applicable to all future preset audio routing).

  **End-of-arc audio routing table (post-round-65):** spike height ← `stems.bass_energy_dev` (per-beat, ~2 Hz at 120 BPM); swell amplitude ← `features.arousal` (slow, ~5 s low-pass); aurora intensity ← `stems.drums_energy_dev_smoothed` (sub-beat envelope via 150 ms EMA); aurora drift ← `features.accumulated_audio_time × features.arousal` (orbital, 10s-of-seconds); aurora hue ← `stems.vocals_pitch_hz` with `features.valence` fallback (melodic). No two visual layers share an audio timescale.

  **Gates:** every round passed build + lints + applicable tests; no SwiftLint regressions on touched files; `Scripts/check_drums_beat_intensity.sh` + `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` both pass post-arc. Per-round visual gates passed via fixture rendering at production resolution (1920×1080 from R57 onward) per the Session 4.5 Phase A test-resolution lesson. Performance baseline measured at end of arc: p95 = 6.51 ms at 1080×823 against 7.0 ms target (~7% headroom). **Files changed across rounds 50-65 (deduplicated):** `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/FerrofluidOcean.metal`, `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/Shaders/RayMarch.metal`, `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`, `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Visual/FerrofluidOceanVisualTests.swift`, plus various test-fixture parameter updates. **Memory notes created or extended during this arc:** `project_ferrofluid_constant_field_premise.md` (R50), `project_accumulated_audio_time_not_clock.md` (R58 root-cause), `feedback_height_field_sdf_lipschitz.md` (R56 SDF technique), `feedback_fixture_live_parity.md` (round-57 G-buffer-branch amendment), `feedback_audio_layer_one_primitive.md` (R65 generalized rule).

**Session 4.5c Phase 1 documentation + certification close-out ✅ (2026-05-17 → 2026-05-18, rounds 66-69, 4 commits).** Documentation reconciliation + Matt's M7 sign-off + `certified: true` flip. **R66 (2026-05-17):** Ferrofluid Ocean README reconciliation against the rounds 50-65 build state — last-amended header updated, mandatory traits + audio routing + constant-field premise + anti-references all brought current, render-pipeline history section added documenting the SDF/MESH/SDF re-pivot. **R67 (2026-05-18):** CLAUDE.md updates capturing the two arc-defining lessons as Failed Approaches — `#66` (test/prod G-buffer dispatch parity) + `#67` (one audio timescale per visual layer) — with corresponding "Do not" entries; memory notes extended (`feedback_fixture_live_parity.md` round-57 amendment) and authored (`feedback_audio_layer_one_primitive.md`). **R68 (2026-05-18):** Mandatory-traits checkboxes in the README flipped to ✓ where the round-65 implementation satisfies them; new "Cert-readiness summary" section itemizes counts against §12.1 / §12.2 / §12.3 minimums + all 12 anti-reference failure modes addressed + perf headroom + outstanding R69/R70 work. **R69 (2026-05-18):** M7 contact sheet authored at `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/ferrofluid_ocean/M7_R69/` (5 frames sampled across Love Rehab + Money on Ferrofluid Ocean in the 2026-05-18T13-50-15Z session; side-by-side analysis against `04_specular_razor_highlights.jpg` and `08_lighting_aurora_over_dark_water.jpg`); `FerrofluidOcean.json` description rewritten to reflect rounds 50-65 + D-126/D-127, `certified: false → true` flipped; `FidelityRubricTests.swift` `certifiedPresets: Set<String>` ground truth extended with `"Ferrofluid Ocean"` alongside `"Lumen Mosaic"` (both certified despite the automated heuristic gate failing — Ferrofluid Ocean because matID==2 bypasses the V.3 mat_* cookbook in favor of Leitl four-layer fluid_shading per D-126; same rationale shape as Lumen Mosaic's matID==1 emission path). Matt's binding M7 sign-off ("Ferrofluid Ocean approved and certified") landed 2026-05-18 after review of the R69 contact sheet against the curated references. **Gates:** engine build clean; `swift test --filter "FidelityRubric"` 27/27 pass; `swift test --filter "Ferrofluid"` 7/7 pass; no SwiftLint regressions. **Outstanding (not blocking cert):** cert-grade benchmark at full 1920×1080 deferred to formal perf-card harness increment (current measurement at 1080×823 has headroom but is not the cert-grade benchmark resolution). **Closes Increment V.9.**

**Session 4.5c Phase 1 ⏳ (initial draft — superseded by the ✅ entry above).** Direct audio → aurora routing in `rm_ferrofluidSky`, replacing the §5.8 stage-rig that was retired earlier in this session (`ea1b9ee8`, D-127). The musical contract is preserved verbatim — vocals pitch → hue, drums energy → intensity, arousal → drift — only the implementation abstraction changes from "orbital point lights + slot-9 buffer ABI + `FerrofluidStageRig` CPU class" to "lighting-fragment-bound `FeatureVector` + `StemFeatures` sampled inline at sky-sample time." One continuous aurora curtain at fixed elevation (`R.y ≈ 0.83`, ~33° from zenith — matches the retired-rig orbit geometry the `04_*` / `08_*` reference framings anchor on). Curtain wraps the sky azimuthally as a soft-edged wedge; orbital drift advances the wedge's centre azimuth at `accumulated_audio_time × mix(0.5, 1.0, arousal) × 2π/30s` (full revolution ~30 s at high arousal, ~60 s at low; pauses at silence via `accumulated_audio_time`'s energy-paused clock). Hue blends `vocals_pitch_hz` (perceptual log-scale over 80 Hz – 1 kHz, ±0.20 phase shift, confidence-gated at ≥0.6) with `features.valence` mood fallback (smooth crossfade window 0.5 → 0.7 confidence so hue does not pop at the boundary). Intensity is `0.30 baseline + 0.50 × drums_energy_dev_smoothed` where the 150 ms τ EMA on `drumsEnergyDev` runs CPU-side in `RenderPipeline.drawWithRayMarch` and lands in the renamed `StemFeatures.drumsEnergyDevSmoothed` float (was `_sfPad1` — byte offset 168, struct size unchanged at 256 bytes per `CommonLayoutTest`). Silence gate `smoothstep(0.02, 0.10, totalStemEnergy)` collapses the curtain to base sky. **GPU contract change:** `StemFeatures` is now bound to `raymarch_lighting_fragment` at fragment slot 3 (matches G-buffer pass convention; non-matID-2 branches ignore slot 3). **Files changed** (10): `Common.metal` + `PresetLoader+Preamble.swift` (struct field rename), `StemFeatures.swift` (public API rename + doc), `RayMarchPipeline+Passes.swift` + `RayMarchPipeline.swift` (lighting-pass stems threading), `RenderPipeline.swift` + `RenderPipeline+RayMarch.swift` (EMA smoother + `frameDt` lift), `RayMarch.metal` (sky function rewrite + `rm_palette` helper + lighting-fragment signature + dead `kFerrofluidSky*` constexpr block removed), `MatIDDispatchTests.swift` (`StemFeatures.zero` default), `VISUAL_REFERENCES/ferrofluid_ocean/README.md` (Last-amended + stylization caveat + mandatory audio reactivity + silence fallback + Audio routing notes — D-127 routing replaces §5.8 rig routing). **Gates:** engine `swift build` clean (6 s); app `xcodebuild build` clean; `CommonLayoutTest` (size invariants) + `MatIDDispatchTests` + `StagedCompositionTests` + `PresetAcceptanceTests` + `PresetRegressionTests` + `PresetVisualReviewTests` all pass (16 tests / 6 suites, 0.10 s). Full engine suite 1234/1236 pass; two failures both pre-existing flakes unrelated to this work (`MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout` documented in test baseline memory; `SoakTestHarness.cancel` passes 0.719 s in isolation, fails 12.2 s in full-suite under parallel contention — classic Swift Testing parallel-execution timing flake on a 5-second deadline test). **STOP gate pending:** Phase 1 acceptance is Matt's eye on a real-music capture against a vocal-forward test track. Love Rehab (used for Session 4.5b deviation-only-failure diagnosis) has zero high-confidence vocal pitch across all 7,493 frames so the pitch-driven hue path never activates there — the mood-valence fallback runs 100% of the time on that capture. Matt's 2026-05-14 sign-off names **Billie Jean (Michael Jackson)** as the vocal-forward replacement test track. Phase 2 (baseline+modulation routing + 8s warmup smoothness) is gated on Phase 1 sign-off. **Carry-forward to Phase 2:** apply the baseline-while-music-plays + deviation-modulated pattern to `fo_swell_scale` and `fo_spike_strength` (currently deviation-only — failing on sustained-volume music); smooth the proxy↔stem warmup crossover so no behavioural-change moment lands at the stem-pipeline-ready boundary.

**Session 4.5 Phase 0 ✅ (2026-05-13, commit `cda15d47`).** Reverted the three Session 4 Phase A decoration layers — Cassie-Baxter spike-tip droplets, meso domain warp, matID == 2 micro-normal perturbation — that the M7 review rejected as decoration without load-bearing musical role (Failed Approach #62). `FerrofluidOcean.metal` returned to pure height-field SDF (Gerstner swell + Rosensweig spikes only). `RayMarch.metal` matID == 2 branch dropped the micro-normal block; surface normal returned to G-buffer stored normal. `PresetDescriptor.FerrofluidParams` trimmed from 5 fields to 2 (thin-film thickness baseline + arousal range only). `FerrofluidOcean.json` ferrofluid block reduced to 2 fields. `FerrofluidParamsDecoderTests` rewritten to 2-field shape (7 tests). Visual smoke: pure gray-blue mirror reflecting current IBL gradient (current state pre-rebuild). Gates: 15/15 regression hashes pass, all touched files SwiftLint-clean, grep gates clean for touches. 5 files / 286 deletions / 54 insertions.

**Session 4.5b Phase 1 ✅ (2026-05-14).** Scaffolding for Leitl-style particle-driven moving peaks landed. Introduced a new per-preset baked-height-texture path: `FerrofluidParticles` Swift class owns a 2048-particle UMA buffer (positions only at Phase 1; SPH-lite motion lands in Phase 2) and a **1024×1024 r16Float UMA texture** (bumped from the original 512² spec under Matt's product addendum so spikes stay crisp at fullscreen / 4K). A new compute kernel `ferrofluid_height_bake` (`Renderer/Shaders/FerrofluidParticles.metal`) bakes the height field using Quilez's polynomial smooth-min (w=0.1) + `almostIdentity` apex smoothing — Leitl's `height-map.frag.glsl` technique adopted verbatim per Failed Approach #65. New GPU contract reservation: **fragment texture slot 10 = per-preset baked height field**; the preamble's `raymarch_gbuffer_fragment` declares `texture2d<float> ferrofluidHeight [[texture(10)]]` and a file-scope `constexpr sampler kFerrofluidHeightSampler(coord::normalized, filter::linear, address::clamp_to_zero)`. Non-Ferrofluid ray-march presets receive a 1×1 zero-filled `RayMarchPipeline.ferrofluidHeightPlaceholderTexture` so the slot-10 declaration is always satisfied. **sceneSDF preamble forward declaration grew one parameter** (`texture2d<float> ferrofluidHeight`) — all 5 ray-march preset sceneSDF signatures updated (GlassBrutalist/KineticSculpture/LumenMosaic/VolumetricLithograph silence with `(void)ferrofluidHeight;`; FerrofluidOcean reads it via the new `fo_ferrofluid_field_sampled` helper). Phase A inline `fo_ferrofluid_field_inline` retained for diagnostic comparison; sceneSDF now calls the sampled path. Initial particle positions at Phase 1: `canonicalInitialPosition(forIndex:)` places particles at the same scaled-space integer cell + per-cell `voronoi_cell_offset` hash a `voronoi_smooth` cell-center pass would emit (CPU port of `Utilities/Texture/Voronoi.metal`'s `voronoi_hash_int`/`voronoi_cell_offset`). World-XZ patch [-10, 10] × [-8, 12] (20×20 wu) covers the camera frustum with margin; clamp-to-zero outside. Bake runs once at preset apply in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.applyPreset` via `particles.bakeHeightField(commandQueue:)`. New API: `RenderPipeline.setRayMarchPresetHeightTexture(_:)`; threaded through `RayMarchPipeline.render(...)` → `runGBufferPass` slot-10 binding. Test harness updates: `FerrofluidOceanVisualTests.renderDeferredRayMarch` instantiates + bakes particles for every fixture so all six visual gates exercise the sampled path. Phase A's silence (01) and quiet (04) renders are **byte-identical** to main (`md5` matches across both fixtures — confirms the `fieldStrength <= 0` early-exit path is preserved in the sampled helper). Steady-mid (02) and beat-heavy (03) differ at the texture level (different smooth-min function from main's `voronoi_smooth(p.xz, 4, 32)` — Quilez polynomial soft-min over particle distances vs exp/log soft-min over neighbour cells); structural equivalence (hex-pack pyramid field + organic non-uniformity) is preserved by construction (particles sit at voronoi cell centers) and confirmed by the existing gate assertions (`lit > 100`, no clipping, mood-tint diff thresholds all pass). Gates: 7/7 new `FerrofluidParticlesTests` pass (locked constants, canonical positions bounded + unique, buffer-contents-match-canonical, texture descriptor locked, bake idempotent, bake non-zero output); 6/6 `FerrofluidOceanVisualTests` pass; engine suite passes (1256 tests / 2 pre-existing parallel-timing flakes — `MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout` + `SoakTestHarness.cancel`; both pass in isolation; both pre-date Phase 1). Engine + app build clean. **Out-of-scope finding flagged:** `PhospheneAppTests` build fails on `.fluid`/`.abstract` enum references — pre-existing fallout from `[D-123] family: align taxonomy to cream-of-crop themes; drop catch-alls` (commit `cf67793c`) where the `PresetCategory` refactor was not propagated to app-layer tests. Verified pre-existing by stashing Phase 1 changes and rebuilding `main` — same failure surface. Confirms my Phase 1 work has not regressed anything; the app-test infrastructure rot pre-dates this increment. Recommend filing a separate "PhospheneAppTests enum drift" cleanup increment. **Carry-forward to Phase 2:** SPH-lite particle update compute pass (spatial-hash + audio forces — `bass_energy_dev` rising pressure, smoothed `drums_energy_dev` shock impulse, `accumulated_audio_time` rotational drift, `arousal` magnitude scale); replace the one-shot init-time bake with a per-frame compute dispatch (bake budget at 1024² × 2048 particles ≈ 2 ms per frame on Apple Silicon, well under 60 fps budget). Per-frame bake means the existing `setRayMarchPresetHeightTexture` API still works — only the dispatch site moves from preset-apply to per-frame tick. STOP gate satisfied: Phase 1 scaffolding produces structurally equivalent output to current main (byte-identical at silence/quiet; structurally equivalent at steady-mid/beat-heavy). Side-by-side PNGs at `docs/diagnostics/V9_session_4_5b_phase1/{01_silence,02_steady_mid,03_beat_heavy,04_quiet}_{main,phase1}.png` for Matt's visual verdict. **Visual verdict requires Matt's review** — Claude cannot read PNG colour content; the structural gates that DO check non-trivial output, no-clipping, and dispatch-active diffs all pass with the new texture-sample path.

**Session 4.5 Phase A ✅ (2026-05-14).** Rebuilt the matID == 2 lighting paradigm from Cook-Torrance per-light loop to **mirror-reflects-procedural-sky** + **smooth Voronoi spike geometry**. The path took several iterations after Matt called out a confidence/discipline failure ("you've been wrong on this point practically every time") and directed desk research into how the problem is actually solved in the field. Robert Leitl's audio-reactive WebGL ferrofluid (closest published reference to Phosphene's use case) surfaced as the canonical technique: **smooth Voronoi (Inigo Quilez)** for the height field instead of regular Voronoi — the C¹-continuous height function eliminates cell-boundary normal flips that were producing a visible "dot pattern" artifact at production resolution. (a) **Lighting:** new `rm_ferrofluidSky(R, rig, scene)` and `rm_ferrofluidBaseSky(R, scene)` functions in `RayMarch.metal`. matID == 2 branch now samples sky at the reflection vector, multiplies by thin-film F0, mixes toward base-sky at zenith for atmospheric depth — `rm_finishLightingPass` bypassed entirely for matID == 2 (no diffuse IBL, no separate fog tail). Aurora bands consume `FerrofluidStageRig` outputs reinterpreted as **stripe-at-elevation curtain directions** (not point lights). Anisotropic stripe falloff via `vertFalloff × azim_falloff` produces horizontal aurora curtains rather than circular spotlights. Per-band intensity scale 0.50, base sky brightness midSky=(0.13, 0.07, 0.18). (b) **Geometry:** new `voronoi_smooth(p, scale, k)` utility in `Utilities/Texture/Voronoi.metal` (Quilez's exp/log soft-min over 9 neighbor cells, k=32). `fo_ferrofluid_field` rewritten to use smooth Voronoi + linear cone profile (`max(0, 1 - smoothD/0.6)`) with full hex-cell coverage (kSpikeRadius > circumradius). Per-cell `cellHash` variation dropped (smooth Voronoi doesn't expose discrete cell IDs); per-cell temporal sin oscillation dropped (Failed Approach #33 echo). Spike field is continuous wall-to-wall pyramids when `bass_energy_dev > 0`; fully collapses at silence. **The "rig" no longer represents lights** — it carries audio→sky-parameter routing; the §5.8 musical contract (vocals_pitch → palette phase, drums_energy_dev → intensity, arousal → orbit speed) is preserved at the rig boundary, only the GPU consumption changed. (c) **Tests:** rewrote `testFerrofluidOceanStageRigDispatchActive` → `testFerrofluidOceanSkyReflectionDispatchActive`; rewrote `testFerrofluidOceanMoodTintIBLPropagation` → `testFerrofluidOceanMoodTintSkyBaseShift` (matID == 2 no longer reads IBL textures after the `rm_finishLightingPass` bypass — the gate now exercises the `baseSky × scene.lightColor.rgb` multiply with fog disabled); `testFerrofluidOceanMoodTintAtmosphereShifts` adapted to the new sky path. **Test render resolution bumped 384×216 → 1920×1080 (production-target)** after Matt called out that low-resolution test renders had been hiding artifacts and led to incorrect "production won't show this" assessments. 4-fixture render now ticks a per-fixture rig (not just silence) so steady-mid / beat-heavy / quiet each exercise the rig-driven sky-reflection path. Gates: 6/6 visual tests pass, 7/7 decoder tests pass, 15 presets total + all golden hashes preserve, SwiftLint strict clean on touched files, grep gates clean for touches. 5 files changed / ~513 insertions / 200 deletions across 3 commits (PA1: lighting paradigm, PA2: smooth Voronoi geometry, PA3: test infra + rig doc). **Carry-forward to Session 4.5b (particle motion):** Matt directed (2026-05-14) that the next increment introduces **Leitl-style particle-based moving peaks** — replace the static smooth-Voronoi grid with audio-reactive GPU particles + per-frame height-map bake pass. Decided as a dedicated increment (path β) rather than expanding Phase A scope. Original Phase B (spike profile reshape + Gerstner swell retune) is sequenced after particle motion lands. **Discipline learnings captured in CLAUDE.md:** (i) verify against the artifact at production resolution before asserting facts about production rendering; (ii) when iterative first-principles guessing isn't converging on a problem with known published solutions, escalate to desk research per Failed Approach #49; (iii) when adopting a working reference implementation, adopt the parts that produce its visual character rather than negotiating them away under unverified "redundancy" arguments.

**Session 3 ✅ (2026-05-13).** §5.8 stage-rig lighting recipe landed end-to-end per D-125. New per-preset fragment slot 9 (`StageRigState` — 208 B, 16-byte aligned) bound at both the ray-march G-buffer and lighting passes; non-§5.8 presets receive a zero-filled `RayMarchPipeline.stageRigPlaceholderBuffer` so the slot is always defined (same contract as slot 8 / `LumenPatternState`). MSL struct declared in both `Common.metal` and `rayMarchGBufferPreamble`. Swift mirror in `Shared/StageRigState.swift` with `StageRigStateLayoutTests` regression-locking the 208 / 32-byte sizes. New `RenderPipeline.directPresetFragmentBuffer4` API (+ setter, threaded through every render path: +Draw, +Staged, +MVWarp, +RayMarch + RayMarchPipeline / +Passes). New `PresetDescriptor.StageRig` decoder for the JSON `stage_rig` block (D-125(e) schema; `light_count` clamp [3, 6] + `palette_phase_offsets` length-check). New `matID == 2` branch in `raymarch_lighting_fragment` loops `for (uint i = 0; i < stageRig.activeLightCount && i < 6; i++)` accumulating Cook-Torrance contributions with F0 from `rm_thinfilm_rgb` (same recipe as matID == 3) and calls `rm_finishLightingPass` for the shared IBL ambient + fog tail — screen-space shadow march disabled per D-125(d). New `FerrofluidStageRig` Swift class (first concrete consumer per D-125(f)) owning the slot-9 UMA buffer, ticked from `applyPreset` via `setMeshPresetTick`. Ferrofluid Ocean JSON gets the `stage_rig` block with §5.8-spec values + `complexity_cost.tier2: 7.0 → 5.5`; `sceneMaterial` outMatID changes 3 → 2 to route through the new branch. `testFerrofluidOceanStageRigDispatchActive` proves the slot-9 buffer reaches the shader (avg channel diff 0.66 with test-harness-tuned StageRig vs placeholder, threshold 0.3). Engine suite: 1230 pass / 1 known pre-existing flake (`MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout`). PresetRegressionTests still pass (matID==0 golden hashes unchanged); PBRPortSyncTests pass (rm_thinfilm_rgb unchanged); mood-tint Atmosphere + IBL gates carry forward through matID == 2. SwiftLint clean on touched files. Carry-forward to Sessions 4–5 unchanged. **Tuning of orbital altitude/radius/intensity for the production reference frames is deferred to Session 5 cert review** (the JSON defaults are §5.8-spec; visual tuning happens against `04_specular_razor_highlights.jpg` + `08_aurora_quality_light_over_dark_surface.jpg` at M7).

**Session 2 follow-ups (same-day, 2026-05-13).** Four self-review findings from `/review` landed alongside the Session 2 commits:
- *P1 — renderer-port drift detection.* `RendererPBRPortSyncTests` (commit `2acdd862`) — GPU-dispatched numerical equivalence between the renderer-private `rm_fresnel_dielectric` / `rm_thinfilm_rgb` and their preset-utility-tree originals. Catches ~5e-7 multiplicative drift in either direction. Verified by injecting `*= 0.500001` and confirming both tests fail.
- *P2-A — IBL-path mood-tint coverage gap.* `testFerrofluidOceanMoodTintIBLPropagation` — same valence shift as the fog gate but with a real `IBLManager` bound and fog disabled via the `sceneParamsB.y = 1e6` sentinel, isolating the `ambient *= scene.lightColor.rgb` path. Verified by removing the multiply: avg diff drops 20.17 → 0.037 and the gate fails with the suspect line named.
- *P2-B — scene_fog_near JSON field.* See above. Closes the workaround in the original mood-tint gate.
- *P3-A — rm_finishLightingPass extraction.* The 60-line IBL-ambient + fog tail shared between matID==0 and matID==3 lifted into a `static inline` helper. matID==0 stays byte-identical (PresetRegressionTests pass: 15 presets × 3 fixtures × all hashes locked). Future matID branches (e.g. matID==2 for §5.8 stage-rig in Session 3) call the same helper, eliminating the Failed Approach #24 copy-paste risk (someone forgetting the `ambient *= scene.lightColor.rgb` line on a new matID).

**P3-B — Session 5 perf-budget note.** `scene_far_plane: 30 → 40` widens the ray-march loop budget by up to 33% for grazing rays. The Session-1 `complexity_cost.tier2: 7.0` placeholder was sized against the 30 m far-plane. At Session 5 perf capture, **measure the actual frame time on M1/M2 hardware before signing off cert** — if 40 m × 128 steps exceeds the 7.0 ms tier-2 budget, either reduce the far-plane back down (with consequences for fog reach at depth) or reduce the per-ray step count via `reducedRayMarch` quality level. Cross-reference D-057 (frame-budget step-count multiplier).

**Scope:** Full rebuild per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.3` as rewritten under D-124 (2026-05-13 redirect). Hex-tile Rosensweig spike lattice (`stems.bass_energy_dev` drives field strength) composed on top of a Gerstner-wave macro displacement field (arousal + `drums_energy_dev` accent drives swell amplitude); domain-warped spike positions for organic flow; ferrofluid material with anisotropic reflection along spike axes plus thin-film interference layer via `thinfilm_rgb` from `Utilities/PBR/Thin.metal` (promoted to per-preset mandatory under redirect); distant fog cooling to dark purple; sky-dome IBL cubemap as primary indirect light; stage-rig lighting per §5.8 (NEW recipe under redirect) — 4–6 animated colored point lights in slow orbital motion, beam color rotation routed from `vocals_pitch_hz` (normalized inline, confidence-gated) with `other_energy_dev` fallback, beam intensity routed from `drums_energy_dev` envelope (not onset). Caustic underlighting is removed per redirect.

**Reference set:** see `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/ferrofluid_ocean/` as amended 2026-05-13 (12 images: 7 retained, 5 added, 4 retired per D-124(b)). Dual hero references: `04_specular_razor_highlights.jpg` (specular + lighting) and `01_macro_ferrofluid_at_swell_scale.jpg` (macro framing).

**Done when:** ✅ Same rubric gates; `certified: true` (flipped in commit `ab3156a2`, round 69, 2026-05-18). Anti-reference check: rendered frame does not match the "smooth chrome blob" (`05_anti_chrome_blob_AIGEN.jpg`) nor the "club lighting rig" failure mode named in the anti-references list — both confirmed in R69 M7 review at `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/ferrofluid_ocean/M7_R69/M7_review.md`.

**Verify:** ✅ Same as V.7, plus additional gates: stage-rig beam motion is continuous and arousal-coupled (not beat-strobed); swell amplitude is arousal-only post-round-65 (not pure drums; the original "arousal-baseline + drums-accent" was reverted to arousal-only to resolve the competing-rhythms reading per Failed Approach #67); calm state at silence shows the full Rosensweig spike lattice at constant geometry post-round-50 (the constant-field premise replaced the original "lattice fully collapses" silence destination — `10_silence_calm_body.jpg` now anchors the swell portion only; spike presence is permanent per the ambient-magnetic-field analog). The §5.8 stage-rig recipe and Cook-Torrance point-light implementation specced in Sessions 1-3 were superseded by D-126 (mirror-reflects-procedural-sky) and D-127 (inline aurora from FeatureVector) — the §5.8 musical contract (vocals_pitch → palette, drums_energy_dev → intensity, arousal → orbit speed) is preserved at the rig boundary; the GPU consumption changed.

**Estimated sessions:** 5 (Gerstner + spike field formulation / material + thin-film / stage-rig lighting recipe / audio routing / cert review). **Actual:** 4 sessions + a 4.5-tagged rescue phase covering 69 rounds across 4 architectural pivots (D-124 redirect → D-125 stage-rig → D-126 mirror-reflects-sky → D-127 inline aurora). The session-count overrun is attributable to two costly Failed Approach trips during the rescue phase (`#66` test/prod G-buffer dispatch gap, 6 rounds of misdirected SDF tuning before diagnosis; `#67` one-primitive-per-visual-layer, 9 rounds across rounds 56-65 to converge on the right routing). Both lessons are now generalized to Phosphene-wide architectural rules with CI scripts where applicable.

### Increment V.10 — Fractal Tree v2

**Scope:** Apply to Fractal Tree per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.4`. Bark material with POM + triplanar + lichen patches; procedural leaf clusters at branch tips with leaf material (SSS back-lit); wind animation via curl-noise; seasonal palette synced with valence; golden-hour lighting with long shadows.

**Done when:** same rubric gates; `certified: true`. Performance profile shows POM + foliage within Tier 2 budget (likely requires MetalFX Temporal upscaling at sub-1080p internal render).

**Verify:** same as V.7.

**Estimated sessions:** 4 (bark + POM / foliage / wind animation / seasonal + audio).

---

### Increment V.11 — Volumetric Lithograph v5

**Scope:** Major rework per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.5`. Replace fBM heightfield with `ridged_mf` warped by `curl_noise` (mountainous, not lumpy); mesa terrace secondary displacement; triplanar detail normal; aerial perspective fog (color-shift from warm sky to cool depth); drifting cloud shadows; cutting-plane beat-reveal replaces palette flash; retain mv_warp and pitch-color mapping from MV-3.

**Done when:** same rubric gates; `certified: true`. Terrain reads as mountainous, not lumpy — confirmed against `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/volumetric_lithograph/` annotations.

**Verify:** same as V.7.

**Estimated sessions:** 3 (terrain reformulation / aerial + clouds / cutting-plane + polish).

---

### Increment V.12 — Glass Brutalist v2 + Kinetic Sculpture v2

**Scope:** Fidelity uplift for the remaining ray-march presets not covered in V.7–V.11. Glass Brutalist: board-form concrete lineage (plank impressions, tie-rod holes, weathering — Salk/Scarpa direction, not Ando smooth); detail normals on concrete; POM on walls; pattern-glass material for fins per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §4.5b` (voronoi cellular, NOT fbm-frost); volumetric light shafts through windows. Wet-concrete variant explicitly out of scope — `mat_wet_stone` reserved for other presets. References curated in `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/glass_brutalist/` (8 images, 7 trait slots + 1 anti). Kinetic Sculpture: brushed aluminum material per `§4.2`; polished chrome with anisotropic streaks; dust motes in ambient space.

**Done when:** both presets pass fidelity rubric 10/15 with all mandatory; `certified: true` on both.

**Verify:** same as V.7.

**Estimated sessions:** 3 (Glass Brutalist lift / Kinetic Sculpture lift / joint polish + perf).

## Phase MD — Milkdrop-inspired uplift work stream

**Operative strategy:** [`docs/MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md`](MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md) §12 (inspired-by reframe addendum, landed 2026-05-12). §§1–11 of that doc remain in tree as the historical record of the derivative-posture framing that preceded the reframe; §12 is the operative record going forward. **Decisions D-103 through D-118 are signed off**; the addendum amended six base decisions in place (D-103 / D-105 / D-106 / D-110 / D-111 / D-112) and filed six new ones (D-113 — posture reframe; D-114 — 20-preset release bundle; D-115 — release-bundle composition (Matt's pick pending); D-116 — substantial-similarity discipline rule; D-117 — catalog-ratio framing (deferred); D-118 — read-only analysis tool scope). Empirical basis for both the base strategy and the addendum: [`docs/diagnostics/MD-strategy-pre-audit-2026-05-12.md`](diagnostics/MD-strategy-pre-audit-2026-05-12.md).

**Why this phase exists (revised under inspired-by):** `docs/MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE.md` informed Phosphene's own authoring patterns (MV-0 through MV-3); Phase MD turns the cream-of-crop pack into a long-term *inspiration source* for new Phosphene presets — each uplift is a hand-authored, Phosphene-native creation that honors a source Milkdrop preset's concept and aesthetic. The vehicle for that work is the `mv_warp` render pass (D-027) plus the rest of Phosphene's preset infrastructure (V.1–V.4 utilities, ray-march, MV-3 capabilities); Milkdrop-inspired presets become additional consumers alongside Gossamer / Volumetric Lithograph. Initial planning target is **~200 uplifts** (multi-year work stream, not a finite phase); the **20-preset first-release bundle (D-114)** is the near-term milestone.

**The 20-preset first-release bundle (D-114) is the load-bearing near-term milestone.** Phosphene's first public release ships when the catalog reaches 20 M7-certified presets — a mix of Phosphene-native + Milkdrop-inspired per D-115 (composition pending Matt sign-off; default working assumption: 10 + 10). Current state: 1 certified (Lumen Mosaic) + ~14 production-but-not-all-certified Phosphene-native; gap to 20 is the work this Phase MD section (combined with Phase G-uplift + Phase AV) scopes.

Runs in parallel with Phase V.7+, Phase AV, Phase CC, Phase G-uplift. Cadence after first release: separate release-management decision (not in this phase's scope).

### Increment MD.1 — `.milk` grammar audit (read-only authoring aid)

**Scope (revised per `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12 / D-110 amendment / D-118):** New doc `docs/MILKDROP_GRAMMAR.md` cataloguing the `.milk` expression sub-languages **and** the HLSL `warp_1=` / `comp_1=` surface used across the `presets-cream-of-the-crop` pack. **Reframed as a read-only authoring aid** under the inspired-by reframe — the doc helps an inspired-by author opening a source `.milk` for the first time look up unfamiliar variables / functions / HLSL features. It does **not** drive a transpiler (no transpiler ships per D-110 amendment); HLSL is no longer excluded (every preset in the pack is a viable inspiration source). The audit commits no licensed content (cites the pack as a corpus only).

**Done when:**
- Doc enumerates all variables (bass/mid/treb/time/q1–q32/wave_* / mv_* / ob_* / ib_* etc.) used in the expression sub-languages, with frequency counts over the full 9,795-preset corpus.
- Top-20 built-in functions (sigmoid, clamp, above, below, if_then_else etc.) have Phosphene-side authoring-equivalent notes (reference for inspired-by authors, not transpiler emission spec).
- HLSL surface section (first-class, not appendix) catalogs the `sampler_*`, `GetPixel`, `GetBlur1/2`, `tex2D` etc. surface present in the 81% of pack presets that ship HLSL; each entry notes the Phosphene-side authoring equivalent (a Phosphene primitive an inspired-by author can reach for) — **never** an automated translation spec (D-110 amendment + D-116 discipline rule).
- Frequency + HLSL-presence summary reports descriptive statistics over the full pack. No transpiler coverage gate.

**Verify:** Manual review against 10 randomly-sampled preset files spanning themes / sizes / HLSL presence.

---

### Increments MD.2 / MD.3 / MD.4 — RETIRED

**Status:** Retired entirely under the inspired-by reframe (`docs/MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12, D-110 amendment, D-118).

- **MD.2 (Transpiler CLI skeleton)** — no transpiler ships. `PhospheneTools/MilkdropTranspiler` SPM target was never created and will not be.
- **MD.3 (Per-frame JSON emission + HLSL hand-port playbook)** — the JSON emission half required the transpiler; the hand-port playbook half is also retired (the substantial-similarity discipline rule in `SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.6` / D-116 replaces both translation modes).
- **MD.4 (Per-vertex Metal emission)** — same; no transpiler, no automated emission.

Under the inspired-by reframe, source `.milk` files become reference material that authors read end-to-end before drafting Phosphene-native uplifts. Each Milkdrop-inspired Phosphene preset is hand-authored from scratch against Phosphene's primitives (V.1–V.4 utilities, `mv_warp`, `ray_march`, MV-3 capabilities). The MD.1 grammar doc serves as the read-only reference (D-118). See `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12.7 / §12.9.

---

### Increment MD.5 — First 10 Milkdrop-inspired uplifts (initial release-bundle batch)

**Scope (revised per `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12 / D-103 amendment / D-105 amendment / D-106 amendment / D-111 amendment / D-112 amendment / D-116):** Author 10 Milkdrop-inspired Phosphene presets, hand-crafted from scratch against Phosphene's primitives, each honoring a source `.milk` preset's concept and aesthetic per the substantial-similarity discipline rule (`SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.6` / D-116). All 10 ship under a single family — `milkdrop_inspired` — per D-105 amendment. Settings toggle is `phosphene.settings.visuals.milkdrop.inspired` per D-106 amendment. Each `.metal` / `.json` carries an `inspired_by` provenance block per D-111 amendment. Source-preset candidates draw from the D-112 list (HLSL-free constraint dissolves per D-112 amendment; substitutions encouraged at authoring). **This batch contributes to the 20-preset first-release bundle (D-114).**

**Done when:**
- 10 new presets in `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Milkdrop/` with JSON sidecars. Naming: `<theme>_<source_name>.{metal,json}` per D-105 amendment.
- Each preset's JSON sidecar declares `family: "milkdrop_inspired"`, the appropriate `rubric_profile` (per preset — full or lightweight per author + M7 judgment), and `inspired_by: { milkdrop_filename, original_artist, pack, sha256 }`.
- Each preset passes M7 review against the substantial-similarity discipline rule (`SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.6` / D-116) — no source equations copy-pasted, no source shader logic ported line-for-line, no `.milk` content redistributed.
- Each has a golden-session regression entry and Increment 5.2 acceptance test.
- Orchestrator metadata (`visual_density`, `motion_intensity`, `fatigue_risk`, etc.) hand-authored per preset for planning integration.
- `SettingsStore` + `VisualsSettingsSection` gain the single `phosphene.settings.visuals.milkdrop.inspired` toggle per D-106 amendment; defaults to `true` once the first preset ships.
- `docs/CREDITS.md` "Milkdrop-inspired preset attribution" section enumerates all 10 source-preset references per D-111 amendment.

**Verify:** `swift test --filter PresetAcceptanceTests` + per-preset M7 review against `SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.6` checklist.

---

### Increment MD.6 — Ongoing Milkdrop-inspired uplift batches

**Scope (revised per `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12 / D-103 amendment):** Continued Milkdrop-inspired uplift authoring beyond MD.5's initial batch. **No tier distinction** under the inspired-by reframe (D-103 amendment retired the Classic / Evolved / Hybrid split); every uplift is a `milkdrop_inspired` preset hand-authored against the same discipline rule (D-116). Stem routing, beat anticipation, mood coupling, section awareness, ray-march composition — all per-preset authoring choices, not tier-mandated. Batch size and cadence are release-management decisions (separate from this phase scope).

**Done when:**
- Continued growth of `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Milkdrop/` under the inspired-by framing.
- Each uplift carries `family: "milkdrop_inspired"` per D-105 amendment + `inspired_by` provenance per D-111 amendment + passes M7 review against the D-116 discipline rule.
- `docs/CREDITS.md` extended with each new source-preset reference per D-111 amendment.
- Catalog growth tracked against the long-term ~200-uplift target (`MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12.1). Steady-state catalog ratio question deferred to D-117 trigger.

**Carry-forward:** MD.6 is the long-tail work stream. The 20-preset first-release bundle (D-114) is the first milestone; subsequent bundles ship at the cadence set by release planning.

**Verify:** `swift test --filter PresetAcceptanceTests` per uplift.

---

### Increment MD.7 — Ray-march-composing inspired-by uplifts (formerly Hybrid tier)

**Scope (revised per `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12 / D-103 amendment / D-107):** Inspired-by uplifts that compose `mv_warp` + `ray_march` against a static camera (D-029). **Not a tier** — these are `milkdrop_inspired` presets that happen to use the ray-march backdrop primitive; authoring choice, not classification. The MD.7.0 spike (single-preset proof of the `mv_warp` + `ray_march` composition) lands as one such uplift; subsequent ray-march-composing uplifts batch into the MD.6 work stream. The architectural composition has only Volumetric Lithograph as prior production proof (and VL's `mv_warp` plays against a ray-march scene that is not itself feedback-warped), so the spike is still a high-value increment under inspired-by.

**Done when:**
- The MD.7.0 spike ships: 1 inspired-by preset composed of `["ray_march", "mv_warp", "post_process"]` renders correctly without obscuring either layer. Recommended source-preset inspiration: Geiss *3D-Luz* (D-107 pre-approved starter).
- Frame budget verified on Tier 1 and Tier 2; results recorded.
- Matt confirms the layering reads as designed (feedback warp visible on top, ray-march backdrop visible behind).
- One-paragraph "what we learned" note added to `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12.9 carry-forward table or to a follow-up addendum entry, feeding back into subsequent ray-march-composing uplifts.
- The D-107 pre-approved starters (Geiss *3D-Luz*, Rovastar *Northern Lights*, EvilJim *Travelling backwards in a Tunnel of Light*) remain viable inspiration sources for ray-march-composing uplifts under inspired-by; selection follows D-107 criteria (architectural + thematic + brand fit) applied at the preset-concept level rather than the port-feasibility level.

**Verify:** `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --filter PresetVisualReview` + Matt M7 review against the substantial-similarity discipline rule (`SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.6`).

---

## Phase 6 — Progressive Readiness & Performance Tiering

### Increment 6.1 — Progressive Session Readiness ✅ (2026-04-25)

**Scope:** Replace the binary preparation model with graduated readiness. States: `preparing`, `ready_for_first_tracks` (first N tracks analyzed), `partially_planned` (visual arc provisional), `fully_prepared` (all tracks analyzed, full plan), `reactive_fallback` (no preparation possible).

**What was built:**
- `ProgressiveReadinessLevel` (5-case `Comparable` enum) in `SessionTypes.swift`.
- `SessionManager.startSession()` now returns immediately after connecting; preparation runs in a stored `Task { @MainActor }`. `progressiveReadinessLevel` is published and recomputed from `@Published trackStatuses` subscription on every status change.
- `SessionManager.startNow()` advances `.preparing → .ready` when readiness ≥ `.readyForFirstTracks`; background task continues so remaining tracks are cached during playback.
- `SessionManager.computeReadiness(statuses:trackList:cache:)` — static pure function implementing D-056 rules: consecutive-prefix gate (default threshold = 3), `.partial` tracks count only when profile has BPM + genre tags, `allTerminal` short-circuits to `fullyPrepared`/`reactiveFallback`.
- `PlannedSession.appendingWarnings(_:)` (now `public`) and `PlanningWarning.Kind.partialPreparation(unplannedCount:)` with hand-written Codable (associated value incompatible with `CaseIterable`).
- `VisualizerEngine`: `currentSessionPlanSeed` stored for deterministic re-use; `extendPlan()` rebuilds plan with same seed on readiness update; `progressiveReadinessLevel` subscription drives `buildPlan()`/`extendPlan()` routing.
- `PreparationProgressViewModel`: removed `FeatureFlags` gate; `canStartNow` driven by injected `progressiveReadinessPublisher`; `onStartNow` closure forwarded from `SessionManager.startNow()`.
- `PlaybackChromeViewModel`: `isBackgroundPreparationActive` (`level < .fullyPrepared`) drives teal dot in `PlaybackControlsCluster`.
- 14 new tests: 10 `ProgressiveReadinessTests` (engine) + 2 `PartialPlanTests` (engine) + 2 `PreparationProgressVMReadinessTests` (app). 685 engine tests total; 0 SwiftLint violations.

**Done when:** ✅ User can start playback when first 3 tracks are prepared. ✅ SessionManager exposes readiness level. ✅ Orchestrator partial-plan mode with `partialPreparation` warning. ✅ 14 tests (≥ 6 required).

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine`

---

### ✅ Increment 6.2 — Frame Budget Manager (landed 2026-04-25)

**What was built:** `FrameBudgetManager.swift` — pure-state governor with 6-level `QualityLevel` ladder (`full → noSSGI → noBloom → reducedRayMarch → reducedParticles → reducedMesh`), `Configuration` factories (tier1: 14ms/0.3ms margin; tier2: 16ms/0.5ms margin), asymmetric hysteresis (3 overruns down / 180 frames up), `reset()` on preset change. OR-gate refactor of `RayMarchPipeline.reducedMotion` → `a11yReducedMotion || governorSkipsSSGI` with dedicated setters (D-057). `PostProcessChain.bloomEnabled`, `ProceduralGeometry.activeParticleFraction`, `MeshGenerator.densityMultiplier`, `RayMarchPipeline.stepCountMultiplier` (written to `sceneParamsB.z`). Timing via `commandBuffer.addCompletedHandler` → `@MainActor` hop. `QualityCeiling.ultra` exempts the governor. Debug overlay quality level line. 36 new tests across 5 files. Golden hashes regenerated for VolumetricLithograph + KineticSculpture (preamble compiler optimization). 721 engine tests total; 1 pre-existing flaky timer failure unchanged.

---

### ✅ Increment 6.3 — ML Dispatch Scheduling (landed 2026-04-25)

**What was built:**
- `MLDispatchScheduler.swift` (`Renderer` module): pure-state controller with `Configuration` (tier defaults: 2000ms/30-frame Tier 1, 1500ms/20-frame Tier 2), `Decision` enum (`.dispatchNow / .defer(retryInMs:) / .forceDispatch`), `DispatchContext` value type, and `decide(context:) -> Decision` algorithm. `QualityCeiling.ultra` → `enabled = false` bypass. D-059.
- `FrameTimingProviding` protocol in `MLDispatchScheduler.swift`: `recentMaxFrameMs` + `recentFramesObserved`. `FrameBudgetManager` conforms via extension; test stubs use `StubFrameTimingProvider`. Single rolling buffer (30-slot circular array) in `FrameBudgetManager` serves both governor hysteresis counters and the ML scheduler with no duplicate state. D-059(e).
- `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift` restructured: `runStemSeparation()` hops to `@MainActor`, consults the scheduler, then dispatches back to `stemQueue` via `performStemSeparation()`. `pendingDispatchStartTime` tracks deferral duration; cleared on dispatch and on `resetStemPipeline(for:)` track change.
- `VisualizerEngine` gains `deviceTier: DeviceTier` (stored, set in `init()`), `mlDispatchScheduler: MLDispatchScheduler?`, and `pendingDispatchStartTime: TimeInterval?`. Debug overlay `ML:` row shows current scheduler state (idle / dispatch / defer Nms / force).
- `MLDispatchSchedulerTests.swift`: 10 `@Test` functions. `MLDispatchSchedulerWiringTests.swift`: 5 `@Test` functions (incl. `StubFrameTimingProvider`). 20 new tests total.
- `DECISIONS.md` D-059 (5 sub-decisions). `ARCHITECTURE.md` §ML Inference gains Dispatch Scheduling subsection. `RUNBOOK.md §Jank / dropped frames` updated. `CLAUDE.md` Module Map and §ML Inference updated.
- 747 engine tests; 0 SwiftLint violations. Phase 6 complete.

**Done when:** ✅ Scheduler defers dispatch when recent frames are over budget. ✅ Force-dispatch ceiling prevents stem freeze. ✅ 20 new tests (≥ 4 required). ✅ Zero dHash drift.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "MLDispatchScheduler"`

---

## Phase 7 — Long-Session Stability

### Increment 7.1 — Soak Test Infrastructure ✅ **LANDED 2026-04-26**

**Scope:** Automated 2+ hour test sessions with synthetic audio. Monitor: memory growth, frame timing drift, dropped frames, state machine integrity, permission handling.

**Delivered:**
- `Diagnostics` SPM target: `MemoryReporter` (`phys_footprint` via TASK_VM_INFO), `FrameTimingReporter` (100-bucket histogram + 1000-frame rolling window), `SoakTestHarness` (@MainActor, configurable duration, cancel(), JSON+Markdown reports).
- `SoakRunner` CLI executable with `--duration`, `--sample-interval`, `--audio-file`, `--report-dir` options. `Scripts/run_soak_test.sh` wraps `caffeinate -i` for 2-hour runs.
- `RenderPipeline.onFrameTimingObserved` fan-out closure: single `commandBuffer.addCompletedHandler` source feeds both `FrameBudgetManager` and soak harness. D-060(c).
- `MLDispatchScheduler.forceDispatchCount` public counter.
- Procedural audio fixture: 10s sine sweep (100→4000 Hz) + noise + 120 BPM kicks, generated at runtime. D-060(e).
- 19 new tests: `MemoryReporterTests` (5), `FrameTimingReporterTests` (7), `SoakTestHarnessTests` (7 always-run + 2 SOAK_TESTS=1 gated).
- 766 engine tests total. 0 SwiftLint violations.

**Smoke run results (60s):** Run `SOAK_TESTS=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter SoakTestHarnessTests` to populate.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` (soak tests gated by SOAK_TESTS=1 env var)

---

### Increment 7.2 — Display Hot-Plug & Source Switching ✅ **LANDED 2026-04-26**

**Scope:** Handle external display connect/disconnect during a session. Handle switching between capture modes (system → app → system). Handle playlist reconnection after network interruption.

**What landed:**
- `FrameBudgetManager.resetRecentFrameBuffer()` — clears rolling timing window only, preserving `currentLevel` (D-061(a))
- `DisplayChangeCoordinator` — subscribes to `DisplayManager` publishers; calls `resetRecentFrameBuffer()` on active-screen removal or window move; no session-state changes
- `CaptureModeSwitchCoordinator` + `CaptureModeSwitchEngineInterface` — 5-second grace window on non-`.localFile` mode switches; suppresses `presetOverride` events in `applyLiveUpdate`; raises silence toast threshold to 20 s (D-061(b,c))
- `PlaybackErrorBridge.effectiveThresholdSeconds` — mutable threshold replacing static constant; `silenceToastGraceWindowThresholdSeconds = 20`
- `VisualizerEngine.captureModeSwitchGraceWindowEndsAt` + `isCaptureModeSwitchGraceActive` — grace window state, with `CaptureModeSwitchEngineInterface` conformance
- `SessionPreparer.resumeFailedNetworkTracks()` — retries network-class failures only; pass-through on `SessionManager` (D-061(d))
- `NetworkRecoveryCoordinator` — 2s additional debounce, 3-attempt cap, state guard via injected `sessionStatePublisher` (D-061(e))
- 4 test files: `DisplayChangeCoordinatorTests` (6), `CaptureModeSwitchCoordinatorTests` (5), `NetworkRecoveryCoordinatorTests` (6), `DrawableResizeRegressionTests` (3) — 20 new tests total
- D-061 in DECISIONS.md; ARCHITECTURE.md resilience subsection; RUNBOOK.md 3 new failure modes

**Phase 7 complete.**

---

## Phase MM — Murmuration (promote, redesign, certify)

**Supersedes Phase SB** (below). Matt's 2026-06-03 direction: promote Murmuration to its
own first-class preset (split from the legacy `Starburst.*` files) and **fully redesign the
flock** to faithfully capture the shape and movement of a real starling murmuration, tied to
musical signals — not the cosmetic D-026 + noise-utility pass that Phase SB scoped. The core
problem is structural: the current model is a parametric ellipse of fixed "home slots" with
spring-to-home forces (`Particles.metal` / `ProceduralGeometry`) at **5,000 particles** — it
cannot produce the dense, emergent, morphing mass with a core→edge density gradient that the
references (`docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/murmuration/`) and motion clips show. "Each bird visible"
is the documented anti-reference (`05_anti_countable_individuals`).

**Decisions (2026-06-03):** full redesign · full rename (retire the Starburst name; no separate
radial-burst preset) · May still-refs are current · Matt-supplied motion clips + flocking-research
references drive the temporal contract (recorded in memory `project_murmuration_uplift.md`).

**Drafted musical contract** (one primitive per layer, one timescale, all deviation primitives per
D-026; continuous drivers 2–4× the beat accents; finalized against the clips in MM.1):

| Visual behavior | Audio driver | Timescale |
|---|---|---|
| Shape elongation (ribbon/comma) + macro drift | `bass_att_rel` | slow / continuous (primary) |
| Turning + pivot + density-agitation waves | `drums_energy_dev` + beat | per-beat (accent) |
| Feathered-edge flutter / shimmering periphery | `mid_att_rel` (edge-weighted) | fast |
| Whole-mass breathing (expand ↔ contract) | `vocals_energy_dev` | phrase |
| Sky warmth shift (≤10%, secondary) | `spectral_centroid` | slow |

---

### Increment MM.0 — Identity split + rename ✅ 2026-06-03

**Delivered (mechanical; output byte-identical, golden hashes stable):**
- `git mv` `Starburst.metal` → `Murmuration.metal`, `Starburst.json` → `Murmuration.json`;
  fragment function `starburst_fragment` → `murmuration_sky_fragment` (JSON `fragment_function`
  updated to match); file header comment updated.
- `git mv docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/starburst/` → `murmuration/` (LFS-tracked images preserved);
  README title/identity pass (technical sections flagged historical pending MM.1 rewrite).
- Preset discovery is glob-based (`PresetLoader` pairs each `.metal` with its sibling `.json`),
  so the file rename is transparent to loading; no registry/name-list edits needed for discovery.
- Doc path updates: `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/README.md`, `CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/PRESETS.md`
  (file/name discrepancy marked resolved), `ENGINE/RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md`,
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` Module Map (also corrected a stale mv_warp description), `RUNBOOK.md`
  (removed a stale Starburst mv_warp reference), `MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE.md` live table row,
  `FidelityRubricTests.swift` comment. Historical narrative (DECISIONS D-029 body,
  MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE MV-2 revert story, `archive/`, `diagnostics/`, `prompts/`) left as-is.
- **Scope note:** the `ProceduralGeometry` class / `Particles.metal` engine-shader rename to a
  flock-specific name + its own sibling file (D-097) is **deferred to MM.2**, where the flock
  engine is rewritten — renaming code about to be replaced is churn-on-churn.

**Done when:** ✅ engine + app build clean; ✅ full test suite green (preset loads as
"Murmuration" from the renamed files; golden hashes unchanged).

---

### Increment MM.1 — Reference + motion review → design doc (research-first)  *(draft published 2026-06-03; pending Matt approval)*

**Delivered:** [`docs/presets/MURMURATION_DESIGN.md`](presets/MURMURATION_DESIGN.md) — technique
chosen (**GPU boids over ~7 grid-found neighbours + audio-driven global roost attractor + banking,
simulated in 3D and projected**), grounded in working references (Robert Hodgin *Murmuration*
40K–1M flockers; Rama Hoetzlein three-level flocking; techcentaur boids; McGill biomechanics for
topological neighbours + **orientation-wave dark bands** + critical-noise + flash-expansion).
Infrastructure precedent: `FerrofluidParticles` GPU spatial-binning. Carries the §3 musical contract
(L1–L6), a honest fidelity-risk statement (tuning risk concentrated in MM.2/MM.3), and the open
questions for Matt. **Remaining to close MM.1: Matt's motion-clip notes to finalize the §3 magnitudes
+ approval to proceed to MM.2.**

**Scope:** read the references + Matt's motion clips; decompose the reference signature into
layers; research the working flocking references (Robert Hodgin murmuration, Hoetzlein GPU
flocking, boids implementations, McGill biomechanics analysis — all in memory) and cite them per
the grounding-priority rule. Author `docs/presets/MURMURATION_DESIGN.md`: technique choice +
grounding, particle-count target, the (layer × primitive × timescale) table made concrete from
the video, an honest fidelity-risk statement. **Matt approves the design before any flock code.**
Likely direction: morphing implicit shape-envelope + curl-noise turbulence + cheap grid-based
separation for the feathered edge (GPU spatial-binning precedent: `FerrofluidParticles`).

**Done when:** design doc published + Matt-approved; technique grounded in ≥1 working reference.

---

### Increment MM.2 — Flock engine (the redesign)  *(force-based substrate SUPERSEDED by MM.6; scaffolding kept)*

**Scope:** new flock-specific engine-library shader + conformer (D-097 sibling; this is where
the deferred `ProceduralGeometry`/`Particles.metal` rename lands) at the MM.1 particle count.
**Multi-frame production-path test harness FIRST** (per "test in production-grade pipeline"):
runs the feedback+particles dispatch for N frames at silence and on a beat, measuring silhouette
cohesion + core/edge density gradient. Tune the silence baseline to a dense, cohesive,
density-graded mass (the opposite of the `05_anti_*` failure modes).

**Done when:** silence baseline reads as a cohesive dense mass with a density gradient; harness
asserts it; 60fps-feasible at target count (perf validated in MM.4).

---

### Increment MM.3 — Audio coupling (D-026) + firing evidence  *(force-based coupling SUPERSEDED by MM.6; M7-failed, see below; routing/replay/test scaffolding kept)*

**Scope:** wire the musical contract with deviation primitives; verify the 2–4×
continuous:beat ratio; produce per-route firing evidence from a real-music session
(`features.csv`/`stems.csv`, via `PresetSessionReplay`) — evidence, not assertion.

**CARRY FORWARD the original Murmuration's audio coupling (binding).** MM.3 ports and adapts the
pre-MM `Particles.metal` proven audio mappings onto the boids substrate — it does NOT reinvent them
(that was the "starting over" mistake Matt flagged 2026-06-03). The original's drum turning-wave
propagation = L2 verbatim-in-mechanic; bass elongation = L1; edge-weighted "other" flutter = L4;
vocals density-compression = L5; warmup stem-blend (D-019) + FA #26 cross-genre beat all kept. The
one improvement over the original: convert raw energy → deviation primitives (D-026). See
[`MURMURATION_DESIGN.md` §3.2](presets/MURMURATION_DESIGN.md). **Keep `ProceduralGeometry` /
`Particles.metal` in the tree until MM.3 has ported its audio coupling** — it is the reference source.

**Delivered (2026-06-03, commits `072b2b8c` port · `205ac595` tests · `4ff18f8b` replay · `11767968` lint):**
- `MurmurationFlockGeometry.computeAudio(features:stemFeatures:dt:)` ports the four `Particles.metal`
  routes onto the boids substrate, all from deviation primitives (D-026): **L1 bass** → roost macro
  drift + a guide-segment elongation (Hoetzlein guide-line) → comma/ribbon; **L2 drums** → a curl
  impulse about the flock axis that sweeps as the beat pulse decays (FA #26 cross-genre beat),
  rolling birds without translating the mass (FA #4) + a localized wave-darkening band written to
  `pad0` for the moving dark band; **L4 mid** → inverse-neighbour-count edge flutter; **L5 vocals**
  → tighter inter-bird spacing (the dark pulse). §3.1 coordination: orthogonal-DOF substrate +
  energy/arousal-gated event layer; D-019 warmup blend kept. `FlockParams` → 144 B (MSL mirror).
- Every audio term vanishes at zero input → the MM.2 silence baseline is reproduced exactly (its
  harness stays green). **L3 flash-expansion deferred** per design §9 (Matt 2026-06-03).
- `MurmurationFlockAudioTests` (7 tests) verify every route + the ≥ 2× continuous:beat ratio via
  the **real reset→bin→boids dispatch path**, measured within one geometry (the flock is its own
  control — boids are chaotic + GPU atomic-binning is non-deterministic, so cross-run diffs are
  unreliable). Full engine suite 1384 green; swiftlint --strict 0; app build clean.
- `MurmurationRouteSpecs` registered in `PresetSessionReplay` → a `--preset murmuration` run over a
  recorded session emits the per-route firing evidence pack.

**Done when:** ✅ ratio verified (≥ 2× via real dispatch); ✅ no absolute-threshold reads (D-026
throughout); ✅ each route's routing verified via the production dispatch path. **PENDING (→ MM.5):**
per-route firing evidence from a *real recorded session* (none exists in-repo and live audio can't be
captured headlessly — the diagnostic is built and one command away once Matt records a session) and
the M7 live review (the load-bearing "reads musical + stays calm in calm passages" gate). MM.3's bar
— "the audio coupling demonstrably works at the routing layer" — is met; the perceptual sign-off is
MM.5.

**M7 round 1 FAILED + fixed (2026-06-03, commit `564f4eec`).** First live review: the flock
fragmented into clumps, popped/splashed birds, showed a square-grid artifact — not a murmuration, not
musical. Root cause (live session CSV): the D-026 deviation primitives spike to **~3×** on real music
(`drumsEnergyDev`/`bassEnergyRel` max ~3.2–3.4), but the gains were tuned at input = 1.0 → audio
forces 3–6× too strong, tearing the flock and inverting the Audio Data Hierarchy (FA #4). The routing
tests missed it by capping inputs at 1.0 (FA #66 parity gap). Fix: `tanh`-saturate every driver,
re-tune gains to gentle accents, bound the drift inside the frame, decouple the L2 wave's darkening
(strong) from its curl force (gentle), per-frame edge flutter, + a new **parity invariant test**
(sustained 3×-magnitude audio at 55k → flock stays cohesive). Full suite 1385 green. See
`MURMURATION_DESIGN.md §11.1` + memory `project_deviation_primitive_real_range`. **The live LOOK
(murmuration character + whether the square-grid artifact is gone) is still unverified — needs Matt's
rebuild + re-review; not confirmable headlessly.**

---

### Increment MM.4 — Sky + render polish + performance

**Scope:** upgrade the sky to V.1 noise utilities + palette (secondary — the flock is the hero);
density-accumulation rendering + edge feathering; recalibrate `complexity_cost`; confirm 60fps
@ 1080p (frame-budget governor `activeParticleFraction` downshift already supported).

**Done when:** rubric M1/M2 satisfied on the sky surface; p95 frame time ≤ tier budget.

---

### Increment MM.5 — Certification  *(✅ DONE 2026-06-04, commit `8f313bdc`)*

**Scope:** real-music session, M7 contact sheet vs references + motion clips, Matt approval,
flip `Murmuration.json` `certified: true`, add "Murmuration" to
`FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets`, regenerate golden hashes, update registry / plan /
release notes.

**Done when:** Matt M7-approves; `certified: true`; golden hash regenerated; tests green.

**DELIVERED.** Certified after Matt's review across MM.6 rounds (worm → traverse → musicality →
review pass; "works and can probably be certified soon" → "prepare closeout and certification").
`Murmuration.json certified: true` + `rubric_profile: lightweight` (particle preset — exempt from
the M3 material heuristic by construction, like the other certified feedback/particle presets;
Matt's M7 review is the load-bearing gate per SHADER_CRAFT §12.1); stale "500K starlings"
description rewritten to the real 3D parametric-ellipse flock + global-envelope coupling.
`FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets += "Murmuration"` (kept in sync with the JSON flag).
`MurmurationRoutes.swift` firing specs re-derived against the shipped `murmuration3d_update`
(ENERGY / BEAT / VOCALS per §13.5; were stale, describing the retired emergent substrate).
Deliberately **no `stem_affinity`** — Murmuration is energy-driven (not stem-specific), so neutral
affinity is the honest representation; stem routing is deferred to Matt's "experimentation" phase.
No golden-hash regen needed (golden tests use an inline catalog with dev=0 → neutral affinity for
all; the JSON cert flip does not perturb them). Review pass on session `2026-06-04T16-44-08Z`:
GPU 0.75 ms mean (trivially cheap), zero NaN/inf across 8554 frames, framing holds live; the only
flags (CPU hitches at startup/track-change 0.2%; high beat-grid drift) are pre-existing engine/audio
behavior, not Murmuration (the beat layer is onset-driven, robust to grid drift). Engine 1377 green,
app build clean, lint 0; FidelityRubric / Golden / routing gates pass. Follow-ups (experimentation
phase): `stem_affinity` tuning, `complexity_cost` recalibration to the measured cheapness.

### Increment MM.6 — 3D Murmuration (parametric-ellipse flock)  *(✅ DELIVERED + CERTIFIED 2026-06-04 via MM.5 `8f313bdc`; emergent Flock2 substrate retired after M7 rounds 1–7 all failed live — see RESOLUTION at end of section)*

**Supersedes the force-based substrate of MM.2 and the force-based audio coupling of MM.3.** MM.4
(sky/perf) and MM.5 (cert) now apply to the Flock2 flock and follow this increment.

**Why:** MM.3's M7 live review failed — the force-based flock fragmented/popped/showed a grid artifact
under real audio. Root cause was twofold: deviation primitives spike ~3× (force-magnitude fix landed,
`564f4eec`), AND — more fundamentally — the whole substrate was a hand-derived force-boids
approximation of the published model Matt provided at kickoff. **Failed Approach #73** ("don't build
what's already been built"). The reference is **Hoetzlein's Flock2 (2024, J. Theoretical Biology,
MIT code, github.com/ramakarl/Flock2)**: an *orientation-based* model (neighbour influence = a desire
to TURN via quaternion targets, not summed force vectors) that natively produces what MM.2/MM.3
hand-faked — travelling dark bands **emerge** from alignment+avoidance coupling (MM.3 *injected* a curl
wave), cohesion comes from a **peripheral-boundary turn** (MM.2 used a roost leash that clumps/freezes),
and it is **stable under perturbation by construction** (force-summing is *why* MM.3 shredded under
audio). Audio coupling re-expresses the §3 contract as **gentle biases on the turn-desires**, which
physically cannot fling the flock apart.

**Scope:** PORT Flock2 from its source (`source/flock_types.h`, `flock_kernels.cu/.cuh`,
`app_flock.cpp`) — wholesale, not re-derived from the paper (FA #70/#64). Replace the
`murmuration_boids` integrator + the `MurmurationBird` layout (→ quaternion + speed) + `computeAudio`;
**keep** the conformer/harness/render/sky/governor/replay scaffolding. Re-express L1 bass (drift +
elongation as target/anisotropy bias), L2 drums (intensify the emergent wave on the beat, not a
force), L4 mid (edge-bird turn jitter), L5 vocals (cohesion-strength breathing); L3 still deferred. All
drivers soft-saturated and sized against the real ~3× range (`project_deviation_primitive_real_range`);
**carry the cohesion-under-3×-load test forward** (it caught the MM.3 failure). Full kickoff:
[`docs/prompts/MM6_KICKOFF_FLOCK2_REBUILD_2026-06-03.md`](prompts/MM6_KICKOFF_FLOCK2_REBUILD_2026-06-03.md).
Model + params pre-extracted in memory `project_flock2_reference`.

**Key porting decisions (kickoff §"Porting decisions"):** quaternion bird state; ~7-topological-+-290°-FOV
neighbour query; **unit/scale mapping** (Flock2 is metres / 5–18 m/s — must map to Phosphene's ±2 world,
keep the ratios); drop the roost leash for the boundary term + a soft framing containment (static wide
camera, design §9); port the heading controller faithfully, simplify the full aero only if a term has
no visible effect.

**Done when:** silence flock reproduces Flock2's qualitative behaviour (cohesive morphing mass +
**emergent** travelling bands + feathered edge) vs references/clips; production-path tests green incl.
the carried-forward cohesion-under-load invariant + per-route turn-desire firing; no absolute-threshold
reads; continuous ≥ 2× beat; full suite green, lint 0, app builds; per-route firing evidence from a real
recorded session; **Matt M7 live approval** (the load-bearing gate — not assertable headlessly).

**DELIVERED (2026-06-03).** Hoetzlein's orientation controller (`advanceOrientationHoetzlein` +
`findNeighborsTopological` + libmin `quaternion.cuh`) ported to MSL `murmuration_boids` (quaternion
bird + topological-7/240°-FOV gather + 4 heading rules + reaction-limited control + dynamic-stability
realign). New 64 B `MurmurationBird` (quaternion+target), 208 B `FlockParams`. Silence baseline reads
as a murmuration (cohesive dense core, feathered/stippled edge, detached stragglers, **emergent**
banking; `RENDER_VISUAL=1` frames in `tools/murmuration_reference/frames/`). Banking darkening = true
wing-area-to-camera (`|up.z|`), not an injected channel.

**Two mid-flight design decisions (Matt):**
1. **Faithful aero, NOT simplified** — simulate in literal **metre units** with Flock2's full
   lift/drag/thrust/gravity (source constants) and project metres→clip at render. The flock self-sizes
   by metre-space density (radius ∝ N^⅓); framing/view/domain scale as `cbrt(count)` for
   density-invariance across test (2–6 k) and production counts.
2. **Musicality rethink — global envelope + emergence, NOT per-bird accents.** The self-organizing
   substrate *swallows or inverts* small per-bird injections (the MM.3 drum-roll-wave halved banking;
   mid-flutter increased edge alignment — measured). So drive the flock's **global** state and let the
   structure emerge: **bass** → drift + envelope elongation (ribbon); **bar maneuver** → ONE
   coordinated heading-swing per bar (downbeat-triggered, alternating, energy-gated, drum-modulated) —
   the banking wave **emerges** from the swing (not every beat — too twitchy); **vocals** → active
   vertical dilation (breathing). Per-bird drum-wave + mid-flutter routes **removed**. Empirically:
   the flock's *size* is a stiff emergent equilibrium that tightening a bound can't shrink (only active
   anisotropic forcing — elongation, vertical dilation — moves it robustly).

**Tests** (`MurmurationFlockTests` + `MurmurationFlockAudioTests`, real reset→bin→boids dispatch):
silence baseline, FlockParams stride, silence-zero-drive, bass drift+elongation, bar-maneuver
(banking tracks the bar envelope, multi-bar-averaged), vocals dilation, continuous ≥ 2× maneuver, and
the **carried-forward** cohesion-under-3×-load invariant. The subtle route tests use separately-settled
flocks + long averaging (single within-geometry windows are too noisy under the non-deterministic GPU
binning — flaked under parallel load). Full engine suite 1384 green (×3 parallel runs), lint 0, app
builds. Route specs updated in `MurmurationRoutes.swift`.

**M7 ROUND HISTORY (live reviews, Matt).** R1 split/froze/too-fast (over-tuned off source defaults); R2
frozen cross (speed-scaling broke the lift/gravity balance — reverted to verbatim aero + DT=0.005
sub-stepping); R3 "murmurations of murmurations" internal sub-clusters (over-packed grid → matched source
density); R4 **"birds far too spread out, world still much too large — not convincing, still inferior to
the previous build."**

**ROUND-5 REFRAME — visual density + framing + the camera tilt (2026-06-04).** R4's source-density domain
is a SIMULATION default, not a framed visual — it rendered a small dense core inside a wide sparse spray
(`maxR ≈ 355 m`, ~1.8× whs; the angle-target containment saturated through `mf_fmodulus` and the X/Z wrap
circulated escapees into a halo). Fixes (faithful aero KEPT, gravity unchanged): (1) size the world for
VISUAL density (`whs = 75·cbrt(count/ref)`, `neighborRadius` scales with it so `rNbrs` is counted
accurately, `boundaryCnt` 120→10 = a true topological edge); (2) a **direct-velocity oblate wall**
replaces the saturating angle-target wall as the size/framing controller (no spray, no falling tail, no
overshoot) + gentle flat-bottomed re-centring; (3) the **rounding is a ~34° camera pitch** in the vertex
projection — the flock is a wide disk round in X–Z and thin in Y, so tilting maps its depth into screen
height → a rounded ovoid (ref `01`), no aero change; (4) routes made **homothetic** (proportional to
position, fill don't hollow) + world-relative caps so loud bass gives a framed comma not a thin edge
ribbon. Silence = rounded dense ovoid (ref `01`); loud = coherent framed comma (ref `02`). Test
robustness: audio suite `.serialized`; bar-maneuver asserts **mean banking rises** (not a flaky bar-phase
correlation); loud-cohesion asserts **mean** core-fraction (not the noise-sensitive per-frame min). Full
engine suite **1385 green (×2 full-parallel + ×3 serialized)**, lint 0, app builds. Design doc §12.1.

**ROUND-5 M7 FAILED → ROUND-6 GOVERNOR FIX (2026-06-04).** Live review showed a frozen oval + a small
chaotic sub-flock inside it. The round-5 SHAPE was correct (the frozen oval IS the rounded ovoid); the
failure was a test/prod parity gap (FA #66): the D-057 governor drops `activeParticleFraction` to 0.5, and
the boids integrator ran on `activeCount = particleCount·fraction` — but a **coupled flock cannot drop a
fraction of its birds** (the excluded birds froze in place; the active half re-cohered into the blob).
Every headless test ran at fraction 1.0 → missed it. Fix: integrate ALL birds every frame;
`activeParticleFraction` throttles the **sub-step count** instead (cost-equivalent, flock stays whole).
Regression test `test_governorThrottleFreezesNoBirds` (asserts <2% frozen + cohesive at the throttled
rate) + `mm6_throttled_*` parity render. Generalisable rule added to CLAUDE.md §What NOT To Do (coupled
substrates throttle fidelity, never element count). Full suite **1386 green**, lint 0, app builds. Design
doc §12.2.

**ROUND-6 M7 FAILED → ROUND-7 FREE-WHEELING REWORK (2026-06-04).** R6: "neither looks nor behaves like a
murmuration" — the flock settled into a stable blob (silence renders 24 s apart identical) instead of
ceaselessly morphing. Root cause (FA #73, from the Flock2 source): faithful CONTROLLER, unfaithful WORLD.
The source frames its flock with ONLY the soft peripheral-boundary turn toward a fixed centre (no hard
wall); my round-5 hard wall + per-bird re-centring flat-lined the wheeling. Taproot: the neighbour examine
cap (96) couldn't count r_nbrs to the source's boundary_cnt=120, so I'd used 10 → weak herding → spray →
wall → dead. Fix: remove the wall + re-centring; raise neighborCap 96→512 + boundaryCnt 10→60 so the
boundary-turn frames the flock source-faithfully; lower avoidance 0.05→0.015; PERF early-exit gather
(interior birds exit at boundary_cnt — makes the high cap affordable); 3D far-edge safety for runaways;
wider static view. Silence now MORPHS (banked masses, sweeping wings, comma-tails, shed sub-groups) at
full AND throttled quality. Durable lesson in CLAUDE.md §What NOT To Do (don't bend a ported reference out
of its working regime). Full suite **1387 green**, lint 0, app builds. Design §12.3. Follow-ups: density
(more birds), gather perf for a higher-count ship, audio-route FEEL re-tune for the free-wheeling regime.

**ROUND-7 M7 FAILED → RESOLUTION: PIVOT TO A 3D PARAMETRIC-ELLIPSE FLOCK (2026-06-04, commit `9056dc48`).**
Live review of the free-wheeling rework (and two further iterations) still failed: *"neither looks nor
behaves like a murmuration… the previous version built months ago is still far superior in look and feel.
Have you looked at the code of this version at all?"* — and the flock was extending off-canvas. **Seven M7
rounds (R1–R7) of the emergent Flock2 substrate failed live**; each fix traded one failure for another
(too-fast → frozen → sub-clusters → spray → frozen-oval → dead-blob → off-canvas spray). The convergence
rule of FA #58/#69 fired: iteration that doesn't change the upstream premise means the premise is wrong.
The premise that failed: **pure emergence (free-flight boids) will, on its own, hold one dense framed
on-canvas mass.** It will not — the references teach realistic *motion* (banking → dark bands), but the
*control* (one dense framed morphing mass) comes from the proven 40-round 2D Murmuration
(`Particles.metal`): birds spring-pulled to home slots in a **continuously morphing ellipse**, dense and
framed **by construction**.

Matt's resolving direction (three messages): (a) *"I asked you to REVIEW THE CODE [of the old version],
not replace your work with it"* — learn from the proven architecture, don't just restore the 2D preset;
(b) *"Why are these the only options?"* — rejected the false A/B (keep-emergent vs restore-2D); (c) **"I
have always wanted a 3D version of this preset — this was the whole goal of the uplift. I just don't want
to work on tweaking it for the next 48 hours."** The synthesis: **lift the proven 2D controlled-ellipse
architecture to 3D** — keep the control (spring-to-morphing-ellipse, dense/framed by construction), gain
the third dimension (3D morphing ellipsOID home slots + perspective + depth fade) and real banking
(wing-area-to-camera → the rolling dark bands).

**DELIVERED — `Murmuration3D.metal` + `Murmuration3DGeometry.swift` (a `ParticleGeometry` sibling, D-097;
own `M3DParticle` 64 B layout + `murmuration3d_*` kernels).** 3D ellipsoid home slots with audio-morphed
half-extents; spring-to-home (`3·d + 5·d²`, damping `1 − 3·dt`) from the 2D original; bounded lemniscate
flock-centre drift; perspective projection (camDist 2.6, camPitch 0.35 rad) + depth fade + viewScale 2.1;
banking from turn-rate drives near-black sprite darkening for the dark-band shimmer. Audio brain ported
verbatim from the 2D preset: **bass** → drift + elongation, **drums** → turning-wave/banding, **other** →
flutter + curvature, **vocals** → density compression. 14 000 birds (governor never throttles it at this
cost — controlled flock keeps all birds). Wired into `VisualizerEngine.makeMurmurationGeometry`. **Emergent
Flock2 substrate retired** (`MurmurationFlock.metal` + `MurmurationFlockGeometry` + 2 test files `git rm`'d).

**Verified headlessly** (`Murmuration3DRenderTests`, the look is the deliverable; pace/audio-feel are
Matt's call): `test_framed` asserts framedFrac > 0.95 on-canvas (replicates the vertex projection incl.
viewScale); `test_render` (RENDER_VISUAL=1) — silence frames show a dense tapered 3D mass with near/far
depth gradient morphing comma→ribbon; audio frames show elongated S/boomerang ribbons spanning the frame
with rolling dark bands that shift between shots. Frames in `tools/murmuration_reference/frames/mm3d_*.png`.
Engine **1376 tests green**, app build clean, lint 0.

**1ST LIVE REVIEW → MOTION REWORK (2026-06-04, commit `9b37d359`, design §13.3).** Session
`2026-06-04T15-41-40Z`: *"Better. Consistent shape now, but its movement is more like a worm than a
murmuration"* + ~20 % too slow. The shape was approved; the **motion** read as a worm — root cause was a
`sin(u·π + st)` curvature wave travelling down the long axis (the snake-spine primitive) over a static,
spring-pinned interior. Fix: replace the spine wave with a **wheeling comma** (centred C+S curves rotated
through a turning plane — reshapes, doesn't undulate); add **internal churn** (a flow field smooth in
(u,v,w) advects the home slots so birds stream through the volume — the mass boils); add **continuous
rolling dark bands**; **+20 % speed** via `motionRate = 1.2`. Verified headlessly (framedFrac > 0.95; new
`mm3d_burst_*` 0.2 s frames show the interior reshuffling + bands rolling, not rigid translation). Engine
1376 green, app build clean, lint 0.

**2ND LIVE REVIEW → TRAVERSE (2026-06-04, commit `75d39eaf`, design §13.4).** Session
`2026-06-04T15-59-58Z`: *"Better, but primarily moving in place — needs to drift from one end of the
screen to the other, might require moving the camera back a little."* Motion character was right; the
flock's position stayed mid-frame (drift amp ~0.12 vs flock half-extent ~0.40). Fix: camera back + zoom out
(`camDist` 2.6 → 3.2, `viewScale` 2.1 → 1.3 → flock ~40 % of frame, room to drift) + a slow dominant L↔R
sweep (~34 s each way, clamped ±0.30 x). `test_framed` upgraded to prove framed-across-traverse
(`minFramed > 0.93`) AND a real sweep (`centreXrange > 0.30`). Engine 1376 green, app build clean, lint 0.

**3RD LIVE REVIEW → MUSICALITY (2026-06-04, commit `cd67944a`, design §13.5).** Session
`2026-06-04T16-15-40Z`: *"Steady improvements… the real focus now should be on musicality — how the preset
feels connected to music sources"* (+ traverse still inches, minor). Diagnosis from the session CSVs: the
existing routes were 10–20 % modulations buried under autonomous motion running on a pure-time clock —
that was the disconnect. Fix (global-envelope coupling, `feedback_global_coupling_emergent_substrate` +
Audio Data Hierarchy): smoothed CPU-side envelopes drive `energyEnv` → a **vigor-paced morph clock** +
**swell** + **traverse range** (PRIMARY); `beatEnv` → a **beat-gated agitation wave** (ACCENT); `vocalEnv`
→ density. Gains sized to measured ranges (stem energy ~0.3 mean/0.7 p99; drumsBeat 0→1). `viewScale`
1.3 → 1.05 for swell room. `test_musicality` asserts louder → bigger + more banding than silence;
`test_framed` drives energetic audio and asserts framed + traverse. Engine 1377 green, app build clean,
lint 0.

**CERTIFIED (MM.5, 2026-06-04, commit `8f313bdc`).** Matt approved across the review rounds ("works and
can probably be certified soon" → "prepare closeout and certification"). `Murmuration.json certified:
true`; route specs re-derived; review-pass on `2026-06-04T16-44-08Z` clean (GPU 0.75 ms, 0 NaN, framing
holds). See the MM.5 row above. Design §13 / §13.3 / §13.4 / §13.5. **Experimentation follow-ups (Matt's
"revisit later"):** `stem_affinity` tuning, `complexity_cost` recalibration to the measured cheapness, and
optional deeper beat-coupling (gated by the separate beat-sync work).

## Phase SB — Starburst Fidelity Uplift  *(SUPERSEDED by Phase MM, 2026-06-03)*

> **Superseded.** Phase SB scoped a cosmetic uplift (D-026 routing + V.1 noise utilities +
> materials) that kept the parametric-ellipse flock and 5K count. Matt's 2026-06-03 direction
> is a full flock redesign — see **Phase MM** above. SB.0 (docs prep) already shipped; SB.1–SB.5
> are retired in favor of MM.1–MM.5. The SB text below is retained for historical context only.

Starburst (Murmuration) is the particle-system preset: a murmuration of birds against a vivid sunrise/sunset sky, rendered as a compute-kernel particle field composited over a 2D fragment sky. The preset currently sits at `certified: false` with the full rubric unapplied. Its fragment shader (136 lines) uses its own custom hash/noise/fbm functions rather than the V.1 Noise utility tree, drives audio from raw `features.bass_att` and `stems.vocals_energy` (D-026 violation), and has no materials layer.

This phase applies V.1–V.4 utilities and V.5 reference images to bring Starburst to rubric compliance and Matt-approved certification. It runs independently of Phase MD and in parallel with V.8+ since it touches only `Starburst.metal`, `Starburst.json`, and the murmuration particle kernel in `Particles.metal`.

---

### Increment SB.0 — Documentation prep ✅ 2026-05-01

**Delivered:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — removed stale "no git history" caveat; documented `[increment-id] component: description` commit convention and preference for multiple small commits per increment over one large commit.
- Commit: `5d9731d5 [SB.0] Docs: remove stale no-git-history caveat, document commit conventions`

---

### Increment SB.1 — JSON sidecar audit + routing review

**Scope:** Verify Starburst's JSON sidecar is internally consistent post-D-029, document the audio routing gaps as the baseline for SB.3, and note the family field semantics.

- Confirm `passes: ["feedback", "particles"]` matches the actual render path in `RenderPipeline`.
- Confirm no stale `mvWarpPerFrame`/`mvWarpPerVertex` stubs remain in `Starburst.metal`.
- Audit `Starburst.metal` fragment shader and the murmuration kernel in `Particles.metal` for D-026 violations: raw `features.bass_att`, raw `stems.vocals_energy`, absolute `smoothstep` thresholds against AGC-normalized values.
- Document all D-026 gaps as numbered items for SB.3 to address.
- Note: `family: "abstract"` in the JSON sidecar is the Orchestrator scoring category and is correct — it drives preset-selection heuristics. The "particle system" framing in the README and CLAUDE.md describes the rendering paradigm (D-029 table row), not the aesthetic family. No change needed unless appetite exists to reclassify to a more specific family (e.g., `"organic"` for the murmuration-as-living-flock framing) — defer that decision to SB.1 review.

**Done when:**
- [ ] JSON sidecar fields verified consistent with code.
- [ ] No stale mv_warp stubs present in Starburst.metal.
- [ ] D-026 gap list documented (can be inline commit message or comment in .metal file header).

**Verify:** `grep -n "mvWarp\|mv_warp" PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Starburst.metal` returns empty; `grep -n "bass_att\b\|vocals_energy\b" PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Starburst.metal` confirms remaining D-026 targets for SB.3.

**Estimated sessions:** 0.5 (audit + commit only; no shader edits).

---

### Increment SB.2 — Visual references curation

**Scope:** Populate `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/starburst/` with annotated reference images per the V.5 curation contract (`SHADER_CRAFT.md §2.3`).

- Minimum 4 reference images covering: murmuration silhouette shape vocabulary, sky gradient color palette (peach/amber/rose/lavender/deep blue), cloud detail quality, and particle density-to-silence contrast.
- `README.md` with per-image annotations linking traits to rubric items and target shader behaviour.
- Confirm `swift run --package-path PhospheneTools CheckVisualReferences` lint passes for the starburst folder.

**Done when:**
- [ ] `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/starburst/` passes `CheckVisualReferences --strict` lint.
- [ ] README.md annotations present; at least one image per cascade level (macro/meso/micro/specular-breakup) identified.

**Verify:** `swift run --package-path PhospheneTools CheckVisualReferences --strict`

**Estimated sessions:** 1 (Matt curation session).

---

### Increment SB.3 — Audio routing pass (D-026 compliance)

**Scope:** Replace all raw AGC-normalized energy reads in `Starburst.metal` and the murmuration particle kernel with deviation-primitive equivalents per D-026, and verify the 2–4× continuous-to-beat ratio rule.

- Replace `features.bass_att` with `features.bass_att_rel` for continuous cloud drift.
- Replace `stems.vocals_energy` with `stems.vocals_energy_dev` (positive-only) for vocal warmth accent.
- Replace any absolute `smoothstep(x, y, f.bass)` or similar patterns with deviation-form equivalents.
- Verify murmuration particle kernel: flock cohesion / bird speed / scatter burst should read from `bass_att_rel`, `mid_att_rel`, `drums_energy_dev` respectively, not raw energy values.
- Confirm ratio: continuous motion drivers (sky warmth, cloud drift speed, flock density) should be 2–4× larger contributors than beat-accent drivers (scatter burst, horizon flash).
- D-019 warmup: if `totalStemEnergy` warmup guard is absent, add `smoothstep(0.02, 0.06, totalStemEnergy)` blend per VolumetricLithograph reference.

**Done when:**
- [ ] No raw `features.bass`, `features.bass_att`, `stems.vocals_energy` (unqualified) remain as primary visual drivers.
- [ ] Continuous:beat ratio ≥ 2× for all motion drivers.
- [ ] D-019 warmup present if stems are read.
- [ ] `swift test --filter PresetAcceptanceTests` passes (no regression).

### Increment SB.4 — Detail cascade + materials pass (rubric gate)

**Scope:** Replace Starburst's bespoke `sky_hash`/`sky_noise`/`sky_fbm` with the V.1 Noise utility tree, layer the sky to the mandatory 4-octave minimum, and introduce 3 distinct materials.

- Replace `sky_hash`/`sky_noise`/`sky_fbm` with `perlin2d` + `fbm4`/`fbm8` from the V.1 Noise utility tree (removes duplicate code, adds Perlin quality).
- Sky cloud layer: upgrade from `sky_fbm(uv, 5)` call with custom noise to `warped_fbm` or `fbm8` from the V.1 tree at ≥ 4 octaves. Recalibrate thresholds to fbm centroid-near-0 range (Failed Approach #42: threshold at 0 not 0.5).
- Three materials: (1) sky gradient layer (atmospheric gradient recipe or palette-driven), (2) cloud layer (thin-film / SSS backlit for volumetric softness via V.1 PBR), (3) bird silhouettes (near-black chitin or organic dark material — `mat_chitin` or simple emissive-rim dark). Exact recipes to be chosen with reference images in hand.
- Macro/meso/micro/specular-breakup detail cascade for the sky surface (the primary hero surface):
  - Macro: full-screen gradient arc (existing, correct).
  - Meso: large cloud bank variation via `fbm8` at 0.3–0.5 UV scale.
  - Micro: wisp fine detail via `fbm8` or `warped_fbm` at 0.05–0.1 UV scale.
  - Specular breakup: chromatic scattering near horizon (`chromatic_aberration_radial` from V.3 Color, or IQ cosine palette variation on cloud highlights).

**Done when:**
- [ ] No custom hash/noise/fbm functions remain in `Starburst.metal`; V.1 utility calls used throughout.
- [ ] Hero sky surface uses ≥ 4 noise octaves (M2 rubric pass).
- [ ] ≥ 3 distinct materials present (M3 rubric pass).
- [ ] All 4 detail cascade levels present on sky surface (M1 rubric pass).
- [ ] `swift test --filter FidelityRubricTests` shows Starburst M1+M2+M3 passing.
- [ ] `swift test --filter PresetAcceptanceTests && swift test --filter PresetRegressionTests` pass; golden hash regenerated.

**Verify:** `swift test --filter FidelityRubricTests && swift test --filter PresetAcceptanceTests && swift test --filter PresetRegressionTests`

**Estimated sessions:** 2 (noise/utility migration + cloud detail / materials + specular breakup).

---

### Increment SB.5 — Certification

**Scope:** Full rubric evaluation, Matt-approved reference frame match, and `certified: true` flip.

- Run `DefaultFidelityRubric` against updated Starburst; confirm ≥ 10/15 with all 7 mandatory items passing.
- Matt reviews rendered output against `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/starburst/` reference annotations (M7 manual gate).
- On approval: flip `Starburst.json` `certified` field to `true`; regenerate golden hashes.
- Update `rubric_hints` if any P1–P4 preferred items were addressed (e.g., `hero_specular: true` if a specular band on the horizon cloud layer is present).
- Reclassify `rubric_profile` if applicable (Starburst is a full-rubric preset; `"full"` is correct).

**Done when:**
- [ ] Rubric score ≥ 10/15, all 7 mandatory items pass, per `FidelityRubricTests`.
- [ ] Matt has approved the reference frame match (M7).
- [ ] `Starburst.json` `certified` field flipped to `true`.
- [ ] Golden hash regenerated and committed.
- [ ] `swift test --filter PresetRegressionTests` passes with new hash.

**Verify:** `swift test --filter FidelityRubricTests && swift test --filter PresetRegressionTests` + Matt visual review.

**Estimated sessions:** 1 (rubric run + Matt review + certification commit).

## Phase DSP — DSP Hardening

Targeted fixes to MIR signals where a documented "Failed Approach" mitigation has shipped but the underlying signal quality still degrades the visualization on uncataloged tracks. Each increment is scoped to one signal, lands behind a diagnostic logging gate first, and ships with before/after captures committed under `docs/diagnostics/`.

---

### Increment DSP.1 — IOI histogram half/double voting in `BeatDetector+Tempo`

**Goal:** Fix the half-tempo octave error documented as Failed Approach #17. Replace the single-peak IOI-histogram selection (with its pairwise 2× correction in `applyOctaveCorrection`) with a small voting pass over harmonic candidates {2·BPM₀, 1.5·BPM₀, BPM₀, 0.667·BPM₀, 0.5·BPM₀}, scored by raw bin count + harmonic support + perceptual prior + (optional) metadata-BPM prior. Reuses `BeatPredictor.setBootstrapBPM` injection path; no new dependency, no model.

**Why now:** The existing `applyOctaveCorrection` only handles a pairwise 2× peak comparison and only when a second peak is present and within ratio 1.8–2.2. On 125 BPM kick-driven tracks the estimator still commonly returns ~62 BPM; metadata disambiguation works for cataloged tracks but fails on live recordings, DJ continuous mixes, and niche releases. Voting lets a true tempo win even when the dominant IOI bin sits at half-tempo.

**Implementation order — diagnostic logging FIRST (project principle):**

1. **Land logging only.** Add a `dumpHistogram(label:)` helper to `BeatDetector+Tempo` emitting the top-5 IOI bins (period, count, implied BPM) plus the currently-selected BPM. Gate behind `BEATDETECTOR_DUMP_HIST=1` env var so it stays silent in production. Commit as `[DSP.1] BeatDetector: histogram dump for tempo diagnosis`.
2. **Capture baseline** on the three reference tracks in `CLAUDE.md`:
   - Love Rehab (Chaim) — known 125 BPM
   - So What (Miles Davis) — known 136 BPM
   - There There (Radiohead) — BPM unknown to us; capture whatever the current estimator returns and treat as the "before" value.
   Save dumps to `docs/diagnostics/DSP.1-baseline.txt`.
3. **Implement voting.** Replace `applyOctaveCorrection` with a scoring pass over the five harmonic candidates. Keep the legacy path reachable behind `BEATDETECTOR_LEGACY_TEMPO=1` for one increment so A/B comparison is trivial.
4. **Re-run the same baseline capture** with voting on. Save to `docs/diagnostics/DSP.1-after.txt`. The diff is the change-description evidence.

**Scoring components:**

- **Bin count** at the candidate BPM (the raw IOI evidence; reuse the existing 141-bucket 60–200 BPM histogram).
- **Harmonic support** — bin counts at half-BPM and third-BPM (i.e. 2× and 3× the candidate period) add a fraction of their count to the score. A true tempo has IOI peaks at integer multiples of its period; a half-tempo candidate does not.
- **Perceptual range prior** — soft Gaussian centered at 120 BPM, σ ≈ 40 BPM, across 50–220 BPM. Hard reject anything outside [40, 240] BPM.
- **Metadata BPM prior** (when available) — strong Gaussian centered at the metadata BPM, σ ≈ 4 BPM. The prior wins ties decisively but cannot override overwhelming IOI evidence (see test case 4).

**Files to touch:**

- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/BeatDetector+Tempo.swift` — add `dumpHistogram`; replace `applyOctaveCorrection` with voting.
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/BeatDetector.swift` — only if the metadata-BPM injection point doesn't already exist on `BeatDetector` itself; reuse `BeatPredictor.setBootstrapBPM` pattern.
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/DSP/BeatDetectorTempoTests.swift` — new file for unit-level voting tests on synthetic histograms.
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Regression/BeatDetectorRegressionTests.swift` — extend with reference-track regression cases (existing fixtures unchanged).
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Performance/DSPPerformanceTests.swift` — add voting-budget assertion.
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` — update Tempo section; amend Failed Approach #17 (octave error is no longer a passive limitation).
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — new D-073 entry: "Tempo octave disambiguation via IOI harmonic voting + metadata prior". Document why TempoCNN (AGPL) and Sound Analysis (orthogonal) were rejected.

**Tests — synthetic IOI histograms (`BeatDetectorTempoTests.swift`):**

1. **Half-tempo correction.** Histogram with peak at 0.96 s (62.5 BPM) and a smaller-but-present peak at 0.48 s (125 BPM). With no metadata, voting must pick 125 BPM (harmonic at 2× boosts the 125 candidate above the raw peak).
2. **True slow tempo preserved.** Single dominant peak at 0.92 s (65 BPM) and no peak at 0.46 s. Voting must return ~65 BPM, not double it.
3. **Metadata wins ambiguous case.** Near-equal peaks at 100 BPM and 200 BPM. With metadata BPM = 100, voting returns 100. With metadata BPM = 200, returns 200.
4. **Metadata cannot override overwhelming evidence.** 50× dominant peak at 140 BPM. With metadata BPM = 70, voting still returns 140 (stale-metadata defense).
5. **Out-of-range rejection.** Peak implying 300 BPM. Voting falls back to the strongest in-range candidate.
6. **Empty / sparse histogram.** Fewer than 4 onsets in the buffer: voting returns `nil` / leaves `instantBPM` unchanged. Caller behavior unchanged from today.

**Tests — reference-track regression (`BeatDetectorRegressionTests.swift`):** Driven by recorded onset sequences from the reference tracks. If onset fixtures don't already exist, generate by running the live pipeline against the audio and committing the resulting onset arrays as JSON under `Tests/Fixtures/tempo/`. Assertions:

- Love Rehab, no metadata: BPM ∈ [122, 128] (target 125, ±3).
- Love Rehab, metadata = 125: BPM ∈ [123, 127] (tighter with prior).
- So What, no metadata: BPM ∈ [133, 139].
- So What, metadata = 136: BPM ∈ [134, 138].
- There There, no metadata: lock in the post-voting estimate from the DSP.1-after capture; future changes must consciously update.

Existing tests in `BeatDetectorRegressionTests.swift` must continue to pass without modification.

**Performance budget:** Voting runs once per `computeStableTempo` call (1 Hz cadence — same as today, not per audio frame). Budget: voting + scoring < 50 µs on M1. Add `DSPPerformanceTests` case to enforce. No allocation in the hot path; score buffer fixed-size on the stack or pre-allocated.

**Done when:**

- [ ] Diagnostic logging committed and pushed first; baseline capture in `docs/diagnostics/DSP.1-baseline.txt`.
- [ ] Voting implementation committed in subsequent commits.
- [ ] Post-voting capture in `docs/diagnostics/DSP.1-after.txt`. Diff shows octave correction on Love Rehab and So What.
- [ ] All 6 unit tests in `BeatDetectorTempoTests.swift` pass.
- [ ] Reference-track regression tests pass with the BPM bounds above.
- [ ] Existing `BeatDetectorRegressionTests` pass unchanged.
- [ ] `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` passes (full suite — same pre-existing env failures acceptable; no new failures).
- [ ] `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build` passes.
- [ ] `DSPPerformanceTests` confirms voting < 50 µs.
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` Tempo section updated; Failed Approach #17 amended.
- [ ] `DECISIONS.md` D-073 added explaining voting policy and rejected alternatives.
- [ ] Commit messages follow `[DSP.1] <component>: <description>`. Multiple small commits preferred (logging → baseline capture → voting impl → tests → docs).
- [ ] Push only after the full verification block passes locally.

**Verify:** `BEATDETECTOR_DUMP_HIST=1 swift test --filter BeatDetectorTempoTests && swift test --filter BeatDetectorRegressionTests && swift test --filter DSPPerformanceTests`.

**Out of scope (do not re-litigate):** TempoCNN (AGPL), custom Core ML tempo classifier, Sound Analysis framework, `BeatPredictor` IIR period smoothing, onset-detection itself.

**Reference principle (do not violate):** Continuous energy is the primary visual driver; beat onset pulses are accents only (D-004). This increment improves the accuracy of an accent-layer signal — it does not justify elevating beats in any preset shader.

**Estimated sessions:** 2 (logging+baseline → voting+tests → docs).

**Delivered (2026-05-03 — scope shifted from voting):** Diagnostic harness + analyzer revealed the failure was not classical half-tempo octave error. Two real bugs:
1. `recordOnsetTimestamps` consumed `bandFlux[0]+bandFlux[1]` (sub_bass + low_bass fused) — produced frame-aliased IOIs because each band fired on slightly different frames per kick.
2. Histogram-mode BPM picking has period-quantization bias toward faster BPMs (BPM bucket widths grow with BPM in period space), so the histogram mode systematically picks 144 over 136.

Shipped:
- `recordOnsetTimestamps` now sources from `result.onsets[0]` (sub_bass per-band onset events from `detectOnsets`, which has 400ms cooldown). Never fuses bands.
- `applyOctaveCorrection` replaced with `computeRobustBPM`: trimmed mean of recent IOIs (within [0.5×, 2×] of median).

Reference-track results: love_rehab 117/152→**122–126** (true 125), so_what 152→**135–138** (true 136). For there_there the histogram still reads kick-pattern (140) not underlying meter (~86) — that's a syncopation limitation outside DSP.1's scope and motivates DSP.2. See commits `9f4c8e1e..bbad760f` and `docs/diagnostics/DSP.1-baseline*.txt`. D-075.

### Increment DSP.2 — Beat This! transformer via MPSGraph (offline pre-analysis) + drift-tracker live path

**2026-05-04 pivot.** Originally scoped as a BeatNet (CRNN + particle filter) port; pivoted to Beat This! (Foscarin et al., ISMIR 2024 — transformer encoder, MIT) after a Session-2 audit pass found paraphrased-spec drift in the BeatNet preprocessing stage and weak performance on irregular meters that are load-bearing for Phosphene (Pyramid Song 16/8, Money 7/4, Schism 7/8). The original BeatNet plan is preserved in `docs/diagnostics/DSP.2-beatnet-archive.md`. Decision: **D-077**. The vendored BeatNet GTZAN weights (Session 1 of the original plan, commit `3f5f652b`) are retained as a fallback; everything below describes the Beat This! port.

**Goal:** Compute a high-quality beat / downbeat / time-signature grid once per track during pre-analysis (`SessionPreparer.prepareTrack` running on the cached 30 s preview clip), cache it on `TrackProfile` as a new `BeatGrid` value type, and drive `FeatureVector.beatPhase01` / `beatsUntilNext` analytically from `playbackTime + drift` against that grid. The live audio path runs no transformer; a small `LiveBeatDriftTracker` cross-correlates `BeatDetector`'s sub_bass onset stream against the cached grid in a ±50 ms phase window and emits a smooth drift estimate. Same MPSGraph + Accelerate idiom used by StemSeparator — no CoreML, no third-party C libs at runtime.

**Why now:** DSP.1's diagnosis proved Phosphene's classical-pipeline tempo path is at the ~70% F1 floor. For "as flawless as possible" beat sync (Matt's stated bar) on the irregular-meter tracks the product cares about, a transformer with whole-bar self-attention is the smallest model class that closes the gap. Beat This! is the smallest such model with a stable, MIT-licensed reference implementation and shipped pre-trained weights.

**Architecture mirrors `StemSeparator`:**

```
PhospheneEngine/Sources/ML/
  BeatThisModel.swift            → MPSGraph engine, pre-allocated UMA I/O (mirrors StemModel.swift)
  BeatThisModel+Graph.swift      → MPSGraph build: encoder block stack (mirrors StemModel+Graph)
  BeatThisModel+Weights.swift    → manifest + .bin loading; LN/BN fusion at init where applicable
  Weights/beat_this/             → vendored .bin weights via Git LFS pointers

PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/
  BeatThisPreprocessor.swift     → vDSP resample + STFT + log-mel pipeline (parameters confirmed in Session 1)
  BeatGridResolver.swift         → probability → (beats, downbeats, BPM, meter); peak picking + meter inference
  LiveBeatDriftTracker.swift     → cross-correlation drift tracker; FeatureVector wiring

PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/
  BeatGrid.swift                 → Sendable value type stored on CachedTrackData
```

**Implementation order (sessions, each one PR / commit-chain):**

1. **Session 1 — Architecture audit + weight vendoring. ✅ 2026-05-04.** Commit `9cd0efb8`. Repo cloned at commit `9d787b9797eaa325856a20897187734175467074`. MIT confirmed. `small0` variant chosen: 2,101,352 params, 8.4 MB FP32 (vs `final0`: 20.3 M params, 81 MB). 161 tensors vendored under `PhospheneEngine/Sources/ML/Weights/beat_this/` (Git LFS). Six reference JSON fixtures in `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Fixtures/beat_this_reference/`. `Scripts/convert_beatthis_weights.py` and `Scripts/dump_beatthis_reference.py` written. `docs/CREDITS.md` attribution block added. **Key S1 findings carried into S2/S3:** (a) inference timing measured at 415–530 ms on M1 CPU (`small0`); D-077's "~100–300 ms" estimate was optimistic — MPS will be faster, but S4 must measure and adjust S6's MLDispatchScheduler budget accordingly; (b) SumHead design: `beat_logits = beat_linear_out + downbeat_linear_out` (additive — beats are a *superset* of downbeats, not a separate class); (c) three MPSGraph workarounds required in S3: RMSNorm must be manual (no `layerNormalization` equivalent), SDPA must be manual matmul+softmax (macOS 14 target, `scaledDotProductAttention` is macOS 15+ only), RoPE must be manual cos/sin; (d) single `RotaryEmbedding(head_dim=32)` instance shared across all 9 blocks (3 frontend + 6 transformer) — precompute `freqs` tensor once in S3 and share; (e) 5 `num_batches_tracked` int64 BN buffers skipped at conversion (training-only, not used at inference); (f) torchaudio cannot load .m4a without `torchcodec` — use ffmpeg subprocess for audio decode (already handled in `dump_beatthis_reference.py`).

2. **Session 2 — Preprocessor port (Swift).** Implement `BeatThisPreprocessor` in `Sources/DSP/`. **Parameters confirmed in S1** (all file:line cited in `docs/diagnostics/DSP.2-architecture.md §2`): n_fft=1024, hop=441, sr=22050 (source), n_mels=128, f_min=30 Hz, f_max=11000 Hz, mel_scale="slaney" (area-normalisation, `norm="slaney"`), power=1 (magnitude, not power), log formula = `log1p(1000 × mel)` (matches `beat_this/preprocessing.py:LogMelSpect.__call__`). **Per-stage golden tests against the Python reference**: synthetic impulse, sine, white noise, plus love_rehab first 1500 frames. Per-stage delta dashboard. Tolerance: float32 ULP per stage where mathematically possible; documented numerical bound where not (resampler — soxr in Python, vDSP in Swift). Key resampler note: Beat This! uses `soxr` for resampling, not librosa's `resample`; a vDSP sinc resampler is acceptable but the tolerance test must reflect the actual delta (not assume ULP). Pre-allocate MTLBuffers for the spectrogram output to avoid heap alloc in `process()`. **Done when:** Swift preprocessor matches Python within measured numerical bound on all test inputs; `BeatThisPreprocessorTests` pass (≥5 test cases incl. love_rehab first-1500-frame golden); no heap allocations in `process()` hot path.

3. **Session 3 — Transformer encoder graph (MPSGraph build only).** Build the model graph in MPSGraph: input projection, positional encoding, encoder block stack (multi-head attention + FFN + LN, in the order Beat This! uses), output head(s). No weight loading yet; random init validates shapes. Layer-by-layer shape tests against architecture-doc numbers. Catch attention-head reshape bugs, layer-norm axis mistakes, off-by-one positional encoding. Reference: `StemModel+Graph.swift` for code style. **Done when:** graph builds cleanly; per-layer output shapes match doc exactly; one full forward pass on random input completes; no MPSGraph compilation warnings.

4. **Session 4 — Weight loading + numerical validation.** Implement `BeatThisModel+Weights.swift` mirroring `StemModel+Weights.swift`. Manifest parsing, .bin loading, LN/BN fusion at init where applicable. **Per-layer numerical golden tests against PyTorch FP32**: load the same checkpoint in PyTorch, run the same input through both, dump intermediates after each encoder block, compare. Tolerance: 1e-4 absolute / 1e-3 relative. Warm-predict timing on M1 for 30 s clip. **Done when:** Swift inference matches PyTorch FP32 within tolerance on all six fixtures, layer-by-layer; warm-predict < 300 ms on M1 (loosened from BeatNet's 142 ms; transformer is bigger).

5. **Session 5 — Beat grid resolver + post-processing.** Peak picking on per-frame beat / downbeat probabilities (use the algorithm Beat This! uses; confirm S1). Meter inference (3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/8, 7/8, 11/8, ...) from downbeat spacing distribution; reject implausible meters with a confidence score. BPM from beat spacing — median of inter-beat intervals (no histogram-mode trap from D-075 / Failed Approach #51). `BeatGrid` value type; Sendable, Hashable, Codable for `TrackProfile` cache embedding. **Done when:** end-to-end pipeline on six fixtures: beats within ±20 ms of reference, downbeats within ±40 ms, BPM within ±0.5, time signature correct on ≥5/6.

6. **Session 6 — `SessionPreparer` integration.** Wire `BeatThisModel` into `prepareTrack`. One call per track during preparation; result cached. Extend `CachedTrackData` to include `BeatGrid`. Bump cache version key for invalidation. Respect `MLDispatchScheduler` (D-059): Beat This! is heavier than stem separation; per-call budget needs widening. Recompute Tier 1 / Tier 2 thresholds. Backfill: cached tracks predating Beat This! lazily compute on first access. **Done when:** all production-test playlists prepare with valid `BeatGrid`s; the 919-engine baseline holds; new `BeatGridIntegrationTests` cover preparation, cache hit, cache invalidation.

7. **Session 7 — Live drift tracker + FeatureVector wiring.** `LiveBeatDriftTracker` consumes `BeatDetector.Result.onsets[0]` (sub_bass) and cross-correlates against the cached grid in ±50 ms phase window; smooth drift estimate (EMA, τ ≈ 200 ms). Replace `BeatPredictor` invocations in `MIRPipeline`. `FeatureVector.beatPhase01` and `beatsUntilNext` computed analytically: `phase01 = ((playbackTime + drift - lastBeat) / period).fract()`. Reactive-mode fallback: keep `BeatPredictor` only for the no-cached-grid case; mark deprecated. Visual regression: re-capture goldens for presets that read `beatPhase01` (Arachne, Gossamer, Stalker, VolumetricLithograph). Re-record `docs/quality_reel.mp4` on the user's three reference tracks + Pyramid Song + Money. **Done when:** Phosphene tracks the beat correctly on 5/4, 7/8, 16/8, swing fixtures (subjective + numerical against S1 ground truth); golden hashes regenerated for affected presets; quality reel rerecorded; user signs off.

**Architectural placement (locked 2026-05-04):**

- **Pre-analysis path** (`SessionPreparer.prepareTrack`, offline, runs once per 30 s preview clip): single Beat This! forward pass; output cached on `TrackProfile.beatGrid`. Per-track cost measured at ~415–530 ms on M1 CPU (Python); MPS expected ~100–150 ms but must be measured in S4 before finalising the S6 MLDispatchScheduler budget.
- **Live path** (60 fps render loop): no transformer. `LiveBeatDriftTracker` aligns the cached grid to the live playback timeline via sub_bass onset cross-correlation. `FeatureVector.beatPhase01` / `beatsUntilNext` (floats 35–36) computed analytically. **No GPU contract change** — existing presets unchanged.
- **Replaces:** `BeatPredictor` (deleted in Session 7); `BeatDetector+Tempo.computeRobustBPM` as primary BPM source (kept as ad-hoc reactive-mode fallback).
- **Stays:** `BeatDetector` itself (onset stream still feeds StemAnalyzer + drift tracker); `StructuralAnalyzer` / `NoveltyDetector` (unchanged this increment; possible All-In-One follow-up).

**Test fixtures (acquisition required before Session 1):**

- love_rehab.m4a (electronic ~125 BPM, 4/4) — already vendored.
- so_what.m4a (jazz ~136 BPM, swing) — already vendored.
- there_there.m4a (rock, syncopated kick — DSP.1's load-bearing failure) — already vendored.
- **Pyramid Song (Radiohead) — 16/8 grouped 3+3+4+3+3, extreme irregular-meter stress test.**
- **Money (Pink Floyd) — 7/4.**
- **If I Were With Her Now (Spiritualized) — syncopation plus mid-track meter changes. The fixture that stresses temporal *instability*: a model that locks to one period at the start and rides it through the track will pass Pyramid Song / Money (irregular but locked) and fail here.**

Five of the six fixtures actively stress non-stable-period behavior — only love_rehab is the clean 4/4 control. Pyramid Song / Money / so_what / there_there cover irregular-meter, swing, and offbeat-kick. If I Were With Her Now is the meter-change adaptation gate. If Beat This! tracks all six correctly, the increment is product-ready. If it fails specifically on the meter-change passage, that's the trigger to evaluate streaming-mode inference (re-running the model mid-track) before falling back to All-In-One.

**Tests:**

1. **Unit — `BeatThisPreprocessorTests` (Session 2):**
   - Synthetic impulse / sine / white noise: per-stage match against Python reference within float32 ULP where mathematically possible.
   - Real audio (love_rehab): output within a measured numerical bound vs. the Python reference (set in S1 architecture doc).
   - Zero input → zero output (or model-defined silence vector).
   - No heap allocation in `process()` hot path.

2. **Unit — `BeatThisModelTests` (Session 4):**
   - Weight load → no crash; parameter count matches manifest.
   - Forward pass on random input: per-layer activations match PyTorch FP32 within 1e-4 absolute / 1e-3 relative.
   - Forward pass on six reference fixtures: end-to-end output matches PyTorch FP32 within tolerance.
   - Warm-predict latency on M1 < 300 ms for 30 s clip.

3. **Unit — `BeatGridResolverTests` (Session 5):**
   - Synthetic 120 BPM activation pulses → 120 ± 0.5 BPM, beats every 500 ± 20 ms, time signature 4/4.
   - Synthetic 7/4 at 90 BPM → 90 ± 0.5 BPM, time signature 7/4 detected, downbeats every 7 beats.
   - Tempo change mid-stream (120 → 140 BPM at t = 5 s) → re-locks within the offline post-processing window.

4. **Unit — `LiveBeatDriftTrackerTests` (Session 7):**
   - Cached grid + perfectly-aligned onsets → drift = 0 ± 5 ms.
   - Cached grid + onsets shifted by +30 ms → drift converges to +30 ms within 2 s.
   - No onsets in window → drift estimate decays toward 0 (no runaway).

5. **Integration — `BeatGridIntegrationTests` (Session 6):**
   - Six reference fixtures end-to-end: BPM within ±0.5, time signature correct on ≥5/6, beats within ±20 ms vs. S1 ground truth.
   - **Pyramid Song must read 16/8 (or equivalent grouped meter) with downbeats on the 1 of each 16-cycle.** Load-bearing assertion for the increment.
   - **Money must read 7/4 at ~123 BPM.** Load-bearing assertion.
   - **there_there must read 84–92 BPM** (the meter, not the kick rate). Carries forward from the BeatNet plan as the DSP.1-failure assertion.
   - Cache hit: re-prepare same track → `BeatGrid` reused, no second model call.
   - Cache invalidation: bump model variant string → re-runs.

6. **Performance — `BeatThisPerformanceTests`:**
   - Per-track preparation: < 500 ms on M1 (preprocessing + transformer + post-processing combined).
   - Drift tracker: < 0.1 ms per frame on M1 (live-path budget).

7. **Existing tests:**
   - All 919 engine-test baseline holds.
   - `BeatDetector` unit tests pass unchanged (its onset stream is the drift tracker's input — interface unchanged).
   - `BeatPredictorTests` pass while BeatPredictor exists (until S7 retirement).
   - `MIRPipelineUnitTests` pass — replace BeatPredictor wiring with drift tracker.

**Performance budget:**

- Per-track preparation cost (one-time per 30 s clip): < 500 ms on M1, < 250 ms on M3. Absorbed in the existing playlist-preparation window.
- Live-path cost: < 0.1 ms per frame on M1 (drift tracker only; no transformer at runtime). Negligible vs. the 16.6 ms render budget.
- Memory: < 80 MB for weights (FP16 transformer ~28 MB + activation scratch). Stays well under StemSeparator's 135.9 MB.
- Init cost: < 300 ms for graph build + weight load (one-time at session start).
- Drop-frame behavior in pre-analysis: respect `MLDispatchScheduler` (D-059) — if Beat This! inference would push a frame past budget, defer the dispatch. Track-change resets state.

**Done when (cumulative across sessions):**

- [x] §0 cleanup committed (BeatNet stubs removed; archive marked superseded; D-077 in DECISIONS.md). **2026-05-04.**
- [x] **S1:** Architecture audit `docs/diagnostics/DSP.2-architecture.md` complete; weights vendored under `ML/Weights/beat_this/` (161 tensors, 8.4 MB, `small0`); `Scripts/convert_beatthis_weights.py` reproducible; six reference fixtures captured as JSON ground truth. Commits `afb75954..9cd0efb8`. **2026-05-04.**
- [x] **S2:** `BeatThisPreprocessorTests` pass (5 tests: shape×2 + dcSignal + sineAtMelBin + loveRehab golden match); per-stage golden match max|Δ|=3×10⁻⁵ within tolerance=1e-3; all buffers pre-allocated at init. Commits `d26e3c2b..b2cb5a8b`. **2026-05-04.**
- [x] **S3:** `BeatThisModel` builds zero-init MPSGraph encoder; 5 shape/finiteness tests pass (929/100 suite green); 0 SwiftLint violations. Commit `c71569b1`. **2026-05-04.**
- [x] **S4:** `BeatThisModelTests` pass (9 tests: graphBuilds + inputProjectionShape + outputShape_T10 + outputShape_T1497 + outputRangeIsFinite + weightsLoad_noThrow + outputNonUniform_withRealWeights + inferenceTime_under300ms + loveRehab_gated); real weights loaded from `ML/Weights/beat_this/`; `test_outputNonUniform_withRealWeights` confirms non-uniform output; `test_inferenceTime_under300ms` passes (< 300 ms warm predict); 933 tests / 100 suites; 0 SwiftLint violations. **2026-05-04.**
- [x] **S5:** `BeatGridResolverTests` pass — 8 unit tests + 24 golden fixture tests (6 fixtures × 4 assertions); all six fixtures within tolerance (beats ≥95% within ±20ms, downbeats ≥90% within ±40ms, BPM within ±0.5, meter correct); pyramid_song=3 gate passes; `BeatGrid` value type (Sendable, Hashable, Codable) in `Sources/DSP/`; 945 tests / 102 suites; 0 SwiftLint violations. **2026-05-04.**
- [x] **S6:** `BeatGridIntegrationTests` pass — 4 tests (nilAnalyzer→empty grid, cacheHit short-circuits analyzer, fullPipeline with `DefaultBeatGridAnalyzer` produces non-empty grid at 50 fps, `StemCache.beatGrid(for:)` accessor matches stored data); `BeatGridAnalyzing` protocol + `DefaultBeatGridAnalyzer` injected into `SessionPreparer` (optional, defaults to nil → BeatGrid.empty); `CachedTrackData.beatGrid` field added with `.empty` default; `AnalysisStage.beatGrid` case added; cache-hit short-circuit in `_runPreparation` skips re-analysis on idempotent prepare. Pyramid Song 16/8 / Money 7/4 / there_there assertions remain in S5 golden fixtures (not duplicated here — S6 proves wiring, S5 proves algorithm). 949 tests / 102 suites; 0 SwiftLint violations. **2026-05-04.**
- [~] **S7 — code complete, live in production, pending quality-reel sign-off (2026-05-04):** `LiveBeatDriftTrackerTests` pass (8 original + 7 added in hardening = 15 total); `BeatGridUnitTests` pass (4); `MIRPipelineDriftIntegrationTests` pass (3). `BeatPredictor.swift` doc-deprecated as reactive-mode-only fallback (no `@available` annotation — would cascade warnings into the warnings-as-errors xcconfig app build). `BeatGrid` extended with `beatIndex(at:)`, `localTiming(at:)`, `medianBeatPeriod`, internal `nearestBeat(to:within:)`. `MIRPipeline` gains `liveDriftTracker: LiveBeatDriftTracker` + `setBeatGrid(_:)`; `buildFeatureVector` forks: cached-grid path uses `self.elapsedSeconds` as the playback clock (already track-relative via existing `mir.reset()` in `VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:127`). `VisualizerEngine+Stems.resetStemPipeline(for:)` now installs the cached grid (or clears it on cache miss). `PresetVisualReviewTests.arguments` extended to `["Arachne","Gossamer","Volumetric Lithograph"]`; Stalker is mesh-shader and excluded from regression by construction. **Golden hashes unchanged** — regression fixtures use prebuilt `FeatureVector` instances with `beatPhase01=0` default and never invoke `MIRPipeline`. App-layer wiring test deferred (engine integration test covers the contract; the change is two lines mirroring the existing `setStemFeatures` pattern). **Outstanding:** `docs/quality_reel.mp4` re-record + Pyramid Song / Money / so_what subjective sign-off; flip to `[x]` once Matt watches and confirms phase locks correctly on irregular meters.
- [x] **S8 — BeatThisModel output matches PyTorch reference (2026-05-05):** Four bugs found and fixed: (1) frontend block order `partial → norm(wrong inDim) → conv` corrected to `partial → conv → norm(out_dim)` (pre-S8 norm used the wrong channel count); (2) stem reshape transposed `[T,F]→[F,T]` before NHWC reshape (pre-S8 was a byte-reinterpretation, scrambling the mel spectrogram); (3) BN1d-aware padding pads each mel bin with `−shift/scale` so the padded region maps to zero post-BN (pre-S8 naive zero-fill caused `BN1d(0)==shift` to produce non-zero values at time edges); (4) RoPE pairs adjacent elements `(x[2i], x[2i+1])` not half-and-half `(x[i], x[D/2+i])` (pre-S8 completely wrong attention dot products). Result: love_rehab.m4a max sigmoid 0.9999 vs Python ref 0.9999; 126 frames > 0.5 vs ref 124; 59 beats detected vs 59 in ground-truth fixture. `test_loveRehab_endToEnd_producesBeats` passes without `withKnownIssue`. S7's drift tracker is now live and active for every Spotify-prepared session. Commits `49315657..b9687cbc`. **2026-05-05.**
- [x] **DSP.2 hardening — all four S8 bugs individually regression-locked (2026-05-05):** `test_loveRehab_endToEnd_producesBeats` thresholds raised to `maxProb > 0.99` / `aboveHalf >= 100` (reflecting confirmed post-S8 values). `BeatThisLayerMatchTests.swift` (new): loads `docs/diagnostics/DSP.2-S8-python-activations.json`, runs `predictDiagnostic` on love_rehab.m4a, asserts per-stage min/max/mean within two-tier tolerances — `preTfmTol=2e-3` for stem.bn1d + frontend.linear; `postTfmTol=1e-2` for transformer.norm + head.linear + output stages (covers ~0.3–0.9% delta from non-causal softmax over padded frames). Transformer blocks 0–5 excluded (Python hooks sub-block FFN output before residual; Swift captures full-block output — incompatible; end-to-end coverage via beat_logits/beat_sigmoid is sufficient). `BeatThisBugRegressionTests.swift` (new): Bug 1 gate (`frontendBlocks[N].norm.scale.count == out_dim`); Bug 3 gate (`|stem.bn1d[t,mel]| < 1e-3` for padded frames t∈[1497,1500) on zero input); Bugs 2+4 annotated as covered by layer-match (wrong reshape scrambles stem.bn1d by >50%; wrong RoPE pairing diverges output by >30%); reactive-mode test confirms `setBeatGrid(nil)` fallback returns finite FeatureVector. `LiveBeatDriftTrackerTests` extended with 7 tests (MARK 9–15) covering `currentBPM`, `currentLockState`, `relativeBeatTimes` public APIs. **975 engine tests / 103 suites; 0 SwiftLint violations.** Commits `286e67cf..4eaae5a7`. **2026-05-05.**
- [x] **S9 — barPhase01/beatsPerBar propagation + live Beat This! for reactive mode (2026-05-05):** `FeatureVector` floats 37–38 promoted from padding to `barPhase01` (phrase-level 0→1 ramp, 0 in reactive mode) and `beatsPerBar` (time-signature numerator, default 4). Metal preamble struct updated to match; Swift `init()` seeds `barPhase01=0 / beatsPerBar=4`. `MIRPipeline.buildFeatureVector` writes drift-tracker values on the grid path and 0/4 on the reactive path. `BeatGrid.offsetBy(_ seconds:)` helper added for time-aligning buffer-relative beat grids to track-relative coordinates. `SpectralHistoryBuffer` ring 4 repurposed from `vocals_pitch_norm` to `bar_phase01`; dead `normalizePitch` method and three pitch constants deleted. `SpectralCartograph`: BR panel third row now plots `bar_phase01` (violet, "BAR φ" label). `runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded()` added to `VisualizerEngine+Stems`: fires once per track after 10 s of buffered tap audio when `liveDriftTracker.hasGrid == false`; lazy-loads `DefaultBeatGridAnalyzer` on `stemQueue`; offsets the resulting grid by `(elapsedSeconds − 10)` to track-relative time; installs via `mirPipeline.setBeatGrid()` on `@MainActor`. Effect: ad-hoc / reactive sessions receive phrase-level beat tracking after ≈ 10 s of listening, same as Spotify-prepared sessions. **987 engine tests; 0 new SwiftLint violations; golden hashes unchanged.** Commit `b6a6095f`. **2026-05-05.**
- [x] `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` passes (pre-existing flakes in `MetadataPreFetcher` / `MemoryReporter` acceptable).
- [ ] `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build` passes.
- [ ] No `import CoreML` anywhere in the engine.
- [ ] CLAUDE.md Module Map updated; CREDITS.md Beat This! attribution present.

**Verify (per session, run cumulatively at the end):** `swift test --filter BeatThisPreprocessor && swift test --filter BeatThisModel && swift test --filter BeatThisLayerMatch && swift test --filter BeatThisBugRegression && swift test --filter BeatGridResolver && swift test --filter LiveBeatDriftTracker && swift test --filter BeatGridIntegration && swift test --filter BeatThisPerformance`.

**Out of scope (do not re-litigate):**

- aubio (native C dependency; rejected — staying within Swift / MPSGraph idiom).
- madmom (offline-only Python+C; non-portable to runtime).
- CoreML in any form (project hard constraint, see Failed Approach #20 and CLAUDE.md "ML Inference").
- All-In-One (Kim et al., ISMIR 2023) — strictly more capable (joint beat / downbeat / section), but two-axis scope creep in a single increment. Reserved as a follow-up; the architecture in this increment is designed so the model can be swapped with no upstream / downstream changes.
- Live transformer inference at 50 Hz — explicitly rejected; the pre-analysis-then-drift-track architecture is the load-bearing design choice.
- Per-frame downbeat *visual presets* — separate work; this increment exposes `downbeats` on `BeatGrid`, presets opt in later.
- Streaming-mode Beat This! inference for reactive mode — fallback path keeps `BeatPredictor` (or runs a one-shot transformer pass on the first 10–15 s of live audio). Decide in S7.

**License sourcing:**

- Beat This! is MIT-licensed; pre-trained weights ship with the official repo. Vendored with attribution in `docs/CREDITS.md` (S1 ✅).
- The architecture itself is published in Foscarin et al., ISMIR 2024 — implementing it from the paper is unencumbered.

**Risks:**

- Weight quantization: BeatNet is trained in FP32; MPSGraph supports FP32 natively. No quantization needed.
- Resampler quality: vDSP_resamplef from 48 k → 22050 Hz must not introduce artifacts that degrade activations. Mitigation: validate against librosa-reference mel-specs in the unit test (step 3).
- Particle-filter stability: known to be the trickiest part. Mitigation: closely follow Heydari's reference impl; test against synthetic constant-BPM and tempo-change scenarios before integrating with real audio.
- Performance: per-frame inference at 100 Hz is more aggressive than StemSeparator's 5 s cadence. Mitigation: enforce < 2 ms per frame in `BeatTrackerPerformanceTests` from the start; if violated, drop to half-rate inference (50 Hz) before considering more invasive changes.

**Reference principle (do not violate):**

Continuous energy is the primary visual driver; beat onset pulses are accents only (D-004). BeatNet's outputs feed accent-layer fields (`beatPhase01`, `isDownbeat`) only — they do not displace the continuous-energy fields driving primary visual motion.

**Estimated sessions:** 5–7 (weights + mel-spec → 1, MPSGraph build + inference → 2, particle filter → 2, integration + tests + docs → 2).

### Increment DSP.3 — Beat Sync + Diagnostic Environment (audit + fixes)

**2026-05-05 audit.** Full architecture audit of the Beat This! BeatGrid lifecycle, live drift tracking, reactive-mode surface, Spectral Cartograph diagnostic coverage, FeatureVector product contract for complex meters, and test fixture gaps. Audit document: `docs/diagnostics/DSP.3-beat-sync-test-environment-audit.md`.

**Root cause of observed "Phosphene shifts into Reactive mode" when switching to Spectral Cartograph:** The `SpectralCartographText` overlay labels `lockState=0` as "REACTIVE." When `LiveBeatDriftTracker` is in UNLOCKED state — either because `resetStemPipeline(for:)` has not yet fired (music not started) or because fewer than 4 tight-match onsets have been accumulated — the orb reads "REACTIVE" even though `livePlan` is non-nil and the engine is in planned mode. This is a display ambiguity, not a session mode regression. However, a second structural problem makes Spectral Cartograph unusable as a held diagnostic surface: `DefaultLiveAdapter` mood-override fires every ~60 seconds when the current preset scores 0.0 (diagnostic-excluded), switching the engine away from Spectral Cartograph.

**Sub-increments:**

- **DSP.3.1 — Diagnostic hold + session-mode signal.** `diagnosticPresetLocked` flag in `VisualizerEngine`; suppresses mood-override in `applyLiveUpdate()`. `SpectralHistoryBuffer[2420]` session-mode slot (0=reactive, 1=planned+unlocked, 2=planned+locking, 3=planned+locked). `SpectralCartographText` updated to show "PLANNED · UNLOCKED" / "PLANNED · LOCKING" / "PLANNED · LOCKED" / "REACTIVE." `L` dev shortcut to toggle hold. **✅ 2026-05-05 — commit `56359c07`.**
- **DSP.3.2 — Pre-fire BeatGrid on session start.** At end of `_buildPlan()` after `livePlan` is stored, call `resetStemPipeline(for: plan.tracks.first?.track)`. BeatGrid present before music starts; idempotent via `currentTrackIdentity` guard in `resetStemPipeline`. **✅ 2026-05-05 — commit `56359c07`.**
- **DSP.3.3 — Beat sync observability: text overlays + CSV + calibration shortcuts.** `SpectralCartographText.draw()` extended with beat-in-bar counter ("3 / 4"), drift readout ("Δ +12 ms"), phase offset indicator ("φ+10ms"); `textOverlayCallback` type updated to pass `FeatureVector` per frame; `[`/`]` dev shortcuts for ±10 ms visual phase calibration; `BeatSyncSnapshot` struct (9 fields) for offline analysis; `SessionRecorder.features.csv` gains 9 new beat-sync columns (`barPhase01_permille`, `beatsPerBar`, `beat_in_bar`, `is_downbeat`, `beat_sync_mode`, `lock_state`, `grid_bpm`, `playback_time_s`, `drift_ms`); `SpectralHistoryBuffer[2429]` drift_ms slot; 31 new tests (BeatInBarComputationTests 16+, SpectralHistoryBuffer slot stability 4+, others). Core Text mirroring fix in `DynamicTextOverlay.refresh()`. `docs/diagnostics/DSP.3.3-beat-sync-latency-phase-notes.md`. **✅ 2026-05-05.**
- **DSP.3.4 — Fix three root causes blocking PLANNED·LOCKED in reactive/ad-hoc sessions.** Live diagnostic from session `2026-05-05T21-13-05Z` (features.csv: 12,509 frames in LOCKING, 0 in LOCKED, beatPhase01 frozen at mean=0.99996, grid_bpm=216 instead of ~125) revealed: (1) `BeatGrid.offsetBy` only shifted the ~10 recorded beats; past the last beat `computePhase` clamped `beatPhase01=1.0` permanently and `nearestBeat` returned nil → `consecutiveMisses` grew indefinitely → `matchedOnsets` never reached `lockThreshold=4`. Fix: `offsetBy` now appends extrapolated beats at `period=60/bpm` up to a 300-second horizon and extrapolates downbeats at `barPeriod` beyond that. (2) `runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded` hardcoded `sampleRate: 44100` for `analyzeBeatGrid` despite the tap running at 48000 Hz — mel spectrogram covered wrong duration, BPM detected as ~216. Fix: `VisualizerEngine.tapSampleRate: Double` stored from audio callback `rate` parameter; passed to `analyzeBeatGrid`. (3) `StemSampleBuffer.snapshotLatest(seconds:)` computed count using stored 44100 Hz rate, so a 10-second request retrieved only 9.19 s of real audio. Fix: new `snapshotLatest(seconds:sampleRate:)` protocol overload uses the passed-in rate; `runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded` calls it with `tapSampleRate`. 14 new tests (5 BeatGrid extrapolation + 5 StemSampleBuffer rate overload). **✅ 2026-05-05 — commit `7033ad09`.**
- **DSP.3.5 — Halving octave correction + retry for live Beat This!** Session diagnostic `2026-05-05T22-57-57Z` (features.csv) revealed: (1) Live 10-second Beat This! window detected Love Rehab at 244.770 BPM (2× true 125 BPM) — double-time artefact from short analysis window. (2) Money 7/4 reactive session stayed in REACTIVE throughout — Beat This! on 10 s of Money audio returned an empty grid, with no retry. Fixes: (a) `BeatGrid.halvingOctaveCorrected()` — halving-only correction: while `bpm > 160`, halve BPM and drop every other beat. BPM < 80 intentionally left alone (Pyramid Song genuinely runs at ~68 BPM; doubling would be wrong). Downbeats re-snapped to surviving beats within ±40 ms; `beatsPerBar` recomputed from corrected downbeat IOIs. (b) `VisualizerEngine`: `liveBeatAnalysisDone: Bool` → `liveBeatAnalysisAttempts: Int`; counter allows up to `liveBeatMaxAttempts=2` attempts — first at `liveBeatMinSeconds=10.0 s`, retry at `liveBeatRetrySeconds=20.0 s` if first attempt returned empty grid. (c) `performLiveBeatInference()` extracted from `runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded()` to keep the parent within the 60-line SwiftLint gate; `halvingOctaveCorrected()` applied before `offsetBy()`. 4 new BeatGridUnitTests. Post-validation triage: `docs/diagnostics/DSP.3.5-post-validation-beatgrid-triage.md`. Remaining risk: Money 7/4 still REACTIVE on live path (20-second retry may also produce empty grid); durable fix is Spotify-prepared session (30-second offline window reliable). **✅ 2026-05-05 — commits `eac2e140`, `c068d2b8`.**
- **DSP.3.6 — App-layer wiring test.** Integration test: `SessionPreparer.prepare()` → `StemCache.store()` → `resetStemPipeline(for:)` → `mirPipeline.liveDriftTracker.hasGrid == true`. Five new `PreparedBeatGridWiringTests` in `Integration/` prove the critical chain: (1) prepared non-empty grid → `hasGrid == true`; (2) `hasGrid == true` → `runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded` guard blocks live inference; (3) cache miss → `hasGrid == false` → live inference allowed; (4) `.empty` cached grid → `hasGrid == false` → live inference allowed; (5) track change clears grid. Enhanced source-tagged `BEAT_GRID_INSTALL` logging in `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift` (source=preparedCache/liveAnalysis/none, BPM, beat count, meter, firstBeat, replaced flag) plus `sessionRecorder.log()` one-time event per track. `beat_grid_source` in features.csv deferred (per-frame schema change; session.log entry is sufficient). Policy documented: prepared-cache grid wins; live inference may only *add* a grid when none is present. `docs/diagnostics/DSP.3.6-prepared-beatgrid-wiring-validation.md`. **✅ 2026-05-05.**
- **DSP.3.7 — Live drift validation test.** Replay `love_rehab` via `AudioInputRouter(.localFile)` with prepared BeatGrid; assert LOCKED within 5 s, drift < 50 ms, `beatPhase01` zero-crossings within ±30 ms of ground truth.
- **DSP.4 — Drums-stem Beat This! diagnostic.** Third BPM estimator on isolated percussion, logged alongside the existing two at preparation time. `CachedTrackData.drumsBeatGrid: BeatGrid` (default `.empty`). Step 6 in `SessionPreparer+Analysis.analyzePreview` feeds `stemWaveforms[1]` (drums) into the same `DefaultBeatGridAnalyzer` — same graph, second `predict()` call. `ThreeWayBPMReading` struct + `detectThreeWayBPMDisagreement` pure function added to `BPMMismatchCheck.swift`. Wiring logs: `WIRING: SessionPreparer.drumsBeatGrid` per track; `WARN: BPM 3-way` (preferred) / `WARN: BPM mismatch` (fallback when drumsBPM == 0). No runtime consumption by `LiveBeatDriftTracker`. 7 new 3-way detector tests + 2 integration wiring tests. **✅ 2026-05-06.**

**Done when (gating assertion):** Matt connects a Spotify playlist, preparation completes, switches to Spectral Cartograph, presses `L` to hold, starts music, and observes "PLANNED (UNLOCKED)" → "PLANNED (LOCKING)" → "PLANNED (LOCKED)" within 5 seconds. BPM matches. Beat-grid ticks align with perceived beats. Engine does not switch away. This observation — not unit-test counts — is the production-validation milestone for Beat This!

**Status:**
- [x] DSP.3 audit complete: `docs/diagnostics/DSP.3-beat-sync-test-environment-audit.md`. **2026-05-05.**

## Phase QR — Quality Review Remediation (2026-05-06)

**Origin.** A 7-agent parallel codebase review on 2026-05-06 (Architect / Audio+DSP / ML / Renderer+Presets / Orchestrator+Session / App+UX / Tests+Quality) produced a ranked findings document focused on *precision*, *performance*, and *simplicity* against the "member of the band" product goal. This phase converts those findings into ordered, scoped increments.

**Why a phase, not a single sweep.** The findings span every subsystem and several interact (e.g. sample-rate fixes change BeatGrid input, which affects drift-tracker tests, which affects regression goldens). Sequencing prevents one increment's fix from invalidating another's verification.

**Priority ordering** (do not reorder without re-reading the cross-cutting analysis below):

1. **QR.1 (DSP.4) — Sample-rate plumbing audit.** Highest-precision payoff. Single bug class, five sites, confirmed by three independent reviewers. ✅ 2026-05-06.
2. **QR.2 (OR.1) — Stem-affinity rescaling + reactive-mode TrackProfile fix.** Highest musicality payoff per LOC. ✅ 2026-05-06.
3. **BUG-007.3 attempted 2026-05-07 — reverted same day** (commit `78ade5aa`). Three smaller replacement bugs in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` to be sequenced: BUG-007.4 (downbeat alignment — investigation first, fix scope set after diagnosis) → BUG-009 (halving-correction threshold 160 → 175, ~5 LOC + test) → BUG-007.5 (adaptive-window lock hysteresis, ~30 LOC + test). Total ~1.5 days but each lands independently. See `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for done-when criteria.
4. **QR.3 (TEST.1) — Close silent-skip test holes.** Cheap to do; protects the work in QR.1 + QR.2 from silent regression.
5. **QR.4 (U.12) — UX dead ends + duplicate `SettingsStore`.** Small, isolated, user-visible.
6. **QR.5 (CLEAN.1) — Mechanical cleanup pass.** Pure deletion of dead code + dead comments. Schedule when the four above have landed; ride along with their cleanups.
7. **QR.6 (ARCH.1) — `VisualizerEngine` decomposition.** Largest debt in the codebase. Defer until QR.1–QR.4 ship, then schedule with explicit risk acknowledgement.
8. **QR.7 (CLEAN.2) — Shader noise algorithm consolidation.** Deferred B.3 + B.4 items from QR.5. Not mechanical — algorithm swap with visual impact (value-noise vs gradient-noise; simple fbm vs rotation-matrix fbm). Includes `sdRoundBox` convention migration. Scheduled separately so QR.5 can ship under its "no behaviour change" invariant.

**Cross-cutting context (read before any QR increment):**

- The 2026-05-06 review found **the 44100/48000 sample-rate bug class confirmed at five distinct sites** across three subsystems. DSP.3.4 fixed it once; the underlying pattern (literal `44100` instead of the captured tap rate) recurred in stem separator dispatch, per-frame stem analysis, and `StemSampleBuffer` init. QR.1 closes the class, not just instances.
- The review found **the orchestrator's stem-affinity sub-score saturates** because `stemEnergy` is AGC-normalized at 0.5; summing 2+ matching stems hits ~1.0 trivially. 25% of score weight does not discriminate. QR.2 normalizes against the deviation primitives (D-026) the rest of the system already uses.
- **Reactive mode systematically penalizes presets with stem affinities** because `TrackProfile.empty.stemEnergyBalance == .zero` → presets with declared affinities score 0; presets without score 0.5. Adversarial against the most musically-engaged catalog members. QR.2 fixes both at once.
- The architect's H1 finding (`VisualizerEngine` is a 2,580-line god object with 8 NSLocks + `@unchecked Sendable`) is real but big. QR.6 schedules it after the precision fixes; the smaller QRs do not need decomposition first.

---

### Increment QR.1 (DSP.4) — Sample-rate plumbing audit

**Goal.** Eliminate the literal `44100` sample-rate constant from every site that should use the live tap rate. Capture `tapSampleRate` immutably, propagate through stem separation + per-frame stem analysis + `StemSampleBuffer` + `StemAnalyzer` init + Beat This! live inference. Add a regression test gate so future literal-`44100` reintroductions fail loud.

**Why now.** Three independent reviewers (Architect H1 / Audio+DSP D1 / ML #1+#2) flagged this. Symptoms on a 48 kHz tap: stems are 8.8% time-stretched and pitch-shifted; per-frame stem analysis reads bands at the wrong window; live Beat This! attempts the right fix already (DSP.3.4) but stem-side callers were not audited. Manifests in production as wrong stem energy magnitudes, wrong onset rates, and biased preset scoring on the mid-bar tracks the orchestrator most needs to handle musically.

**Sites to fix (audit-confirmed):**

| File | Symbol / line | Current | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift:179` | `StemSampleBuffer(sampleRate: 44100, …)` | literal | `tapSampleRate` (deferred allocation, or re-init on rate-change) |
| `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift:435` | `StemAnalyzer(sampleRate: 44100)` default arg | literal | thread `tapSampleRate` |
| `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:194` | `runPerFrameStemAnalysis` literal | literal | `tapSampleRate` |

**Concurrency hardening (Architect H1, Audio+DSP D1):**

- `tapSampleRate: Double` is currently mutated from the audio callback (`VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:98`) and read on `stemQueue` (`+Stems.swift:296`) without a synchronization primitive. On Apple Silicon, atomic 8-byte writes are guaranteed but cross-core *visibility* is not. This is the kind of bug that produces wrong-tempo grids ~1-in-1000 sessions and is invisible in tests.
- Fix: capture `tapSampleRate` once per `installTap(...)` call. Promote to `let tapSampleRate: Double` set in the initializer that wires the tap, or guard with `os_unfair_lock` if it must remain mutable for capture-mode switching.
- If capture-mode switching changes the rate (System tap → file playback at a different rate), tear down and re-init the dependent buffers (`StemSampleBuffer`, `StemAnalyzer`) on the rate change rather than mutating the rate field.

**Octave-correction policy unification (Audio+DSP A2):**

`BeatGrid.halvingOctaveCorrected` is halving-only (preserves Pyramid Song ~68 BPM). `BeatDetector+Tempo.computeRobustBPM:196` and `estimateTempo:269` both still double sub-80 BPM. The two policies disagree. Drop the `bpm < 80 → bpm *= 2` branch from both `computeRobustBPM` and `estimateTempo`. Any track in [40, 80) BPM is now treated as genuine, matching the offline path and CLAUDE.md.

**`MIRPipeline.elapsedSeconds: Float` → `Double` (Audio+DSP D3):**

Float accumulation of `+= deltaTime` reaches ULP ≈ 240 µs after 30 minutes — smaller than the ±30 ms tight-match window but a guaranteed monotonic drift. Promote to `Double`. Conversion to `Float` happens once at FeatureVector write. Touches `MIRPipeline.swift:70`, all callers reading `elapsedSeconds`, and `LiveBeatDriftTracker.update(playbackTime:)` parameter.

**KineticSculpture D-026 violation (Audio+DSP B1):**

`Sources/Presets/Shaders/KineticSculpture.metal:102`: `f.sub_bass * 0.28 + f.bass * 0.10` — exact Failed Approach #31 anti-pattern on AGC-normalized fields. Convert to `f.bass_dev` / `f.bass_rel` deviation primitives. Re-record golden hash for the preset.

**Lint gate to prevent recurrence:**

Add a `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` script that fails CI when any `44100` literal appears outside an explicit allowlist (`StemSeparator.modelSampleRate`, `BeatThisPreprocessor` 22050 internal, test fixtures). Wire into the test target's pre-build phase. Same pattern as the existing `check_visual_references` enforcement.

Add a SwiftLint custom rule that flags `f\.(bass|mid|treb|sub_bass|low_bass|low_mid|mid_high|high_mid|high)\s*[*+\-]` in `.metal` files (see Audio+DSP B2). Whitelist deviation suffixes (`_rel`, `_dev`, `_att_rel`).

**Files to touch:**

- `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift`, `+Audio.swift`, `+Stems.swift` — propagate `tapSampleRate`.
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/BeatDetector+Tempo.swift` — drop sub-80 doubling in `computeRobustBPM` + `estimateTempo`.
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/MIRPipeline.swift` — `elapsedSeconds: Double`.
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/LiveBeatDriftTracker.swift` — accept `Double` playbackTime.
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/KineticSculpture.metal` — D-026 conversion.
- `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` (new), `.swiftlint.yml` (custom rule), CI hook.
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Integration/TapSampleRateRegressionTests.swift` (new) — see Tests below.
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/DSP/BeatDetectorTempoTests.swift` — assert no doubling for 60 BPM input.
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` — Failed Approach #52 (sample-rate literal recurrence), update Tempo section, update KineticSculpture entry.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — D-078: "Sample rate is captured once per tap install; literal `44100` is a CI-banned constant."
- `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — close BUG-R002 / BUG-R003 with QR.1 commit hash; add new BUG-R006 (sample-rate plumbing audit), BUG-R007 (octave correction split), BUG-R008 (elapsedSeconds Float drift), BUG-R009 (KineticSculpture D-026 violation).

**Tests:**

1. **`TapSampleRateRegressionTests` (new).** Inject a recording `BeatGridAnalyzing` mock; drive with synthetic 48 kHz audio; assert `analyzeBeatGrid(samples:sampleRate:)` is called with `sampleRate == 48000` and `samples.count == sampleRate * 10`. Repeat for the stem-separator dispatch path with a `RecordingStemSeparating` mock.
2. **Octave-correction unification (`BeatDetectorTempoTests`).** Add: `computeRobustBPM` on synthetic 75 BPM IOIs returns ≈ 75 (not 150). `estimateTempo` on synthetic 65 BPM autocorrelation returns ≈ 65 (not 130). Pyramid Song golden fixture stays at ~68 BPM unchanged.
3. **`MIRPipeline` long-session drift (`MIRPipelineUnitTests`).** Synthetic 60-minute playback; assert `elapsedSeconds.isMultiple(of: 0)` not relevant — instead assert that two repeats of `update(deltaTime: 1/60)` over 1 hour produce a `Double` clock equal to 3600.0 within 1 µs.
4. **Lint gate.** `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` exits non-zero on a synthetic source file containing `let foo = 44100`.
5. **Existing tests.** Full engine suite passes; Pyramid Song / Money golden fixtures unchanged; KineticSculpture golden hash regenerated and committed.

**Done when:**

- [x] All five literal-`44100` sites use `tapSampleRate` (or the canonical `StemSeparator.modelSampleRate` where the post-separation rate is correct, not the tap rate).
- [x] `tapSampleRate` capture is race-free (NSLock-guarded `_tapSampleRate` with `updateTapSampleRate(_:)` writer + `tapSampleRate` reader).
- [x] `computeRobustBPM` and `estimateTempo` no longer double sub-80 BPM.
- [x] `MIRPipeline.elapsedSeconds` is `Double`; `LiveBeatDriftTracker.update(playbackTime:)` widened to `Double`.
- [x] KineticSculpture uses deviation primitives (`0.06 + f.bass * 0.16 + f.bass_dev * 0.05`); golden hash regenerated.
- [x] `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` passes; SwiftLint custom rule for `.metal` deviation form documented as intentionally script-based (SwiftLint cannot lint `.metal`).
- [x] All new tests pass; full engine suite passes (1045 tests, sole failure is the pre-existing `MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout` flake); app build clean.
- [x] CLAUDE.md, DECISIONS.md (D-079), KNOWN_ISSUES.md (BUG-R002/R003 generalized; new BUG-R006/R007/R008/R009), ENGINEERING_PLAN.md updated.
- [x] Manual validation 2026-05-06: ad-hoc reactive session on Love Rehab installed live Beat This! grid at **125.8 BPM** (true 125, sample-rate fix verified at 48 kHz tap); ad-hoc Pyramid Song stayed at **69 BPM** (sub-80 doubling fix verified — pre-QR.1 would have reported 138). KineticSculpture deviation form not directly observed, but golden-hash test passes. Two pre-existing bugs surfaced during testing — neither is a QR.1 regression: BUG-006 (Spotify-prepared session falls through to liveAnalysis — prepared-grid wiring path; QR.1 didn't touch it) and BUG-007 (LiveBeatDriftTracker LOCKING ↔ LOCKED oscillation — lock semantics unchanged by QR.1). Both filed in `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for separate diagnosis.

**Verify:** `swift test --filter TapSampleRateRegression && swift test --filter BeatDetectorTempo && swift test --filter MIRPipelineUnit && bash Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh && swiftlint lint --strict`.

**Estimated sessions:** 2 (audit + propagation → tests + lint gate + golden regen).

**Status:** ✅ 2026-05-06 — D-079 landed (see git log `[QR.1]`). Manual subjective validation completed same day. Two pre-existing bugs (BUG-006, BUG-007) surfaced during validation but are not QR.1 regressions — filed for separate diagnosis.

### Increment QR.2 (OR.1) — Stem-affinity rescaling + reactive-mode TrackProfile fix

**Goal.** Make `stemAffinitySubScore` discriminate. Make reactive mode score stem-affinity-bearing presets fairly. The 25% score-weight slot currently does neither.

**Why now.** Direct hit on the "member of the band" goal. The Orchestrator+Session reviewer's findings #1, #2, and #6 collapse into one root cause: the scorer reads AGC-normalized stem energies as if they were absolute, then sums them. AGC centers each stem at 0.5; any preset declaring 2+ matching affinities saturates at ~1.0 on most music. Two presets with totally different declared affinities end up scoring nearly identically, so the 0.25 weight does no work.

**Algorithm changes:**

1. **`stemAffinitySubScore` reads deviation primitives.** Replace `stemEnergy[stem]` lookups with `stemEnergyDev[stem]` (D-026, MV-1, already on `StemFeatures` floats 17–24). A preset that declares "responds to drums + bass" now scores high only when those stems are *above their AGC average*, not just present at all. Presets with mismatched affinity declarations actually diverge in score on most tracks.
2. **Affinity-weighted (not summed) score.** For a preset declaring N affinity stems, score = mean of `max(0, stem_dev)` over the N stems, NOT clamped sum. Mean preserves "this preset's stems must all be active" semantics; sum allowed any-one-stem to saturate.
3. **`TrackProfile.empty` neutralizes affinity instead of zeroing it.** When `stemEnergyBalance == .zero` (reactive-mode initial state), `stemAffinitySubScore` returns 0.5 for all presets — the same neutral baseline as `affinities.isEmpty`. Otherwise reactive mode systematically rejects the most musical presets.
4. **Live `stemEnergyBalance` plumbing for reactive mode.** `DefaultReactiveOrchestrator` currently uses `TrackProfile.empty`; add an overload accepting a live `StemFeatures` snapshot. After ≥10 s of listening (when the live stem analyzer has converged), score against the live snapshot. Same time scale as the existing reactive-mode confidence ramp.

**Mood-override per-track cooldown (Orchestrator+Session #3):**

`DefaultLiveAdapter.applyLiveUpdate()` currently re-evaluates and re-patches the plan every analysis frame (~94 Hz) when conditions hold. Add a `lastOverrideTimePerTrack: [TrackIdentity: Float]` state with a 30 s cooldown. Suppress override evaluation entirely within the cooldown (don't even build the scoring contexts). Leaves boundary reschedule unaffected (it has its own per-evaluation gate).

**Reactive boundary-only switching gate (Orchestrator+Session #5):**

`DefaultReactiveOrchestrator` currently fires `boundaryFired` switches without a score-gap check, so every confident boundary every 60 s is a coin-flip. Tighten to `boundaryFired AND topScore > currentScore + 0.05` (small gap, not the full 0.20 used for non-boundary switches — boundaries are still preferred, just not random).

**Hard-cut threshold raise (Orchestrator+Session, transitions #3):**

`cutEnergyThreshold = 0.7` paired with `energy = 0.5 + 0.4 * arousal` means any track with `arousal > 0.5` cuts at every track change. Most non-ambient music sits 0.5–0.8. Raise to `cutEnergyThreshold = 0.85` so the warm-crossfade ladder actually fires on most music. A/B-listenable.

**`recentHistory` trim (Orchestrator+Session #4):**

`SessionPlanner+Segments.swift:219` appends to `recentHistory` unbounded; per-track scoring scans the array via `last(where:)`. At ~400 segments this becomes measurable. Trim to last 50 entries on append.

**Files to touch:**

- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Orchestrator/PresetScorer.swift` — `stemAffinitySubScore` rewrite (deviation primitives + mean instead of clamped sum + neutral 0.5 on empty profile).
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Orchestrator/ReactiveOrchestrator.swift` — accept live `StemFeatures` snapshot; tighten boundary-switch gate.
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Orchestrator/LiveAdapter.swift` — `lastOverrideTimePerTrack` cooldown.
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Orchestrator/SessionPlanner+Segments.swift` — `recentHistory` 50-entry trim.
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Orchestrator/TransitionPolicy.swift` — `cutEnergyThreshold = 0.85`.
- `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift` — pass live `StemFeatures` snapshot into `applyReactiveUpdate`.
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Orchestrator/StemAffinityScoringTests.swift` (new).
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Orchestrator/ReactiveOrchestratorTests.swift` — add boundary-gate cases.
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Orchestrator/LiveAdapterTests.swift` — add cooldown cases.
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Orchestrator/GoldenSessionTests.swift` — regenerate goldens; document the changes inline (cite the QR.2 increment).
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` — Failed Approach #53 (stem-affinity AGC saturation) + #54 (reactive `TrackProfile.empty` bias).
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — D-079: "Stem-affinity scoring uses deviation primitives, not absolute AGC-normalized energies."

**Tests:**

1. **`StemAffinityScoringTests` (new).**
   - Two presets with disjoint affinities (e.g. drums-only vs vocals-only) on a drums-heavy track produce score gap ≥ 0.3. (Was ≤ 0.05 pre-fix.)
   - Preset with empty affinities scores neutral 0.5 regardless of track.
   - Preset declaring 2 affinities on a track with one stem at +dev and one at -dev scores ~0.25 (mean of `max(0, +x)` and `max(0, -y)`). NOT 1.0 (sum saturation).
   - `TrackProfile.empty` with non-empty affinities scores 0.5 (neutral), not 0 (rejection).
2. **`ReactiveOrchestratorTests` extension.**
   - Boundary fires with `topScore == currentScore` → no switch (was: switch).
   - Boundary fires with `topScore == currentScore + 0.10` → switch.
   - 60 s cooldown still respected.
3. **`LiveAdapterTests` extension.**
   - 100 consecutive `applyLiveUpdate` calls with conditions held → only one override patch applied (was: 100).
   - Override cooldown clears on track change.
4. **`GoldenSessionTests` regeneration.** All three curated playlists regenerated. Document the score-gap shift in the test file's commit message and inline comments.
5. **Manual validation:** Matt listens to Love Rehab (drums-heavy) and a vocal-led track in reactive mode and confirms the preset selection feels different from the pre-fix baseline. Subjective gate.

**Done when:**

- [x] `stemAffinitySubScore` uses deviation primitives + mean. ✅ 2026-05-06
- [x] Reactive mode receives live `StemFeatures` after 10 s and uses neutral 0.5 before then. ✅ 2026-05-06
- [x] Mood-override 30 s per-track cooldown. ✅ 2026-05-06
- [x] Boundary-switch score gap ≥ 0.05. ✅ 2026-05-06
- [x] `cutEnergyThreshold = 0.85`. ✅ 2026-05-06
- [x] `recentHistory` trimmed at 50. ✅ 2026-05-06
- [x] All new tests pass; goldens regenerated and committed; full engine suite green (1084 pass, 1 pre-existing MetadataPreFetcher flake). ✅ 2026-05-06
- [x] CLAUDE.md (Failed Approaches #53+#54 already present) + DECISIONS.md D-080 updated. ✅ 2026-05-06
- [ ] Matt subjective sign-off on reactive-mode preset selection (Love Rehab + one vocal-led track). (pending)

**Verify:** `swift test --filter StemAffinityScoring && swift test --filter ReactiveOrchestrator && swift test --filter LiveAdapter && swift test --filter GoldenSession`.

**Landed:** 2026-05-06. All algorithmic changes implemented. Golden sequences regenerated — VL no longer dominates (stem bonus gone with zero-dev pre-analyzed profiles); mood+section+tempo now drive planned sessions. D-080 documented. Matt sign-off on reactive-mode listening pending.

**Estimated sessions:** 2 (algorithm changes + tests → goldens regen + manual sign-off).

### Increment BUG-007.3 — Lock hysteresis + live BPM credibility ⚠ REVERTED 2026-05-07

**Outcome:** Implementation in commit `94309858` failed manual validation. Everlong planned regressed (5 → 14 lock drops). Reverted in commit `78ade5aa`. Replacement bugs filed in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: BUG-007.4 (downbeat alignment investigation), BUG-007.5 (adaptive-window hysteresis), BUG-009 (halving threshold). Original spec retained below as historical context — do not re-implement.

---

**Goal (historical).** Stop two failure modes observed on 2026-05-07 manual validation: (C) `LiveBeatDriftTracker` drops lock during natural-music tempo variation even when grid BPM is correct; (D) live BPM resolver returns ~4 % low on busy mid-frequency tracks (Everlong reactive: `grid_bpm=151.9` vs true ≈158, drift walks to −358 ms over 75 s).

**Why now.** Manual validation of two post-QR.2 sessions (`~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-07T13-27-14Z/` planned, `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-07T13-30-46Z/` reactive) showed BUG-007.2 is *not* the end of the lock-stability story. SLTS held LOCKED for 80 s straight but drift walked +15 → −90 ms (correct BPM, expressive timing); Everlong dropped lock 5 times in 50 s; reactive Everlong locked to a 4 % wrong BPM and ran ~one full beat ahead by t=75 s. These are independent of BUG-007.2's adversarial-cadence + horizon-exhaustion fixes. Schedule before QR.3 because the fix touches `LiveBeatDriftTracker` directly and QR.3's `LiveDriftValidationTests` should validate against the corrected lock semantics, not the current ones.

**Sites to fix:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/LiveBeatDriftTracker.swift` | Add `staleMatchWindow: Double = 0.060`. Replace single-gate `isTight` logic with asymmetric Schmitt — tight gate (±30 ms) increments `matchedOnsets`; while already locked, stale-OK gate (±60 ms) preserves lock without incrementing; only true non-stale onsets increment `consecutiveMisses`. Add ring-buffer slope detector (`addDriftSample(playbackTime:drift:)` + `currentDriftSlope() -> Double?`) — 30-entry, returns ms/sec when ≥ 5 samples cover ≥ 5 s. |
| `PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/MIRPipeline.swift` | Publish latest drift slope via new `latestDriftSlopeMsPerSec: Double?` (read in `buildFeatureVector`). |
| `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift` | Extend `runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded()` with a third trigger: when `liveDriftTracker.hasGrid && abs(slope) > 5 ms/s` sustained ≥ 10 s and ≥ 30 s since last attempt (cap 3 attempts/track), retry with **20-second window** instead of 10. New `BeatThisAnalysisRequest` carries `windowSeconds` (10 or 20). On a second high-slope event after the wider retry, log `WARN: live BPM unstable on this track` and *retain previous grid* — do not install a third candidate. |
| `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/DSP/LiveBeatDriftTrackerTests.swift` | New tests: (1) Mechanism C regression — synthetic 158 BPM grid + onset stream with ±25 ms jitter for 60 s asserts ≤ 1 lock drop; pre-fix would drop ≥ 4. (2) Slope-detector unit tests — flat drift returns ≈0 ms/s; linearly walking drift returns slope within 10 % of truth; insufficient samples returns nil. |
| `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Integration/LiveBeatRetryWideningTests.swift` (new) | Mock `BeatThisAnalysisRequest` consumer; verify wider-window retry fires under high-slope condition; verify 30-s cooldown; verify 3-attempt cap; verify second high-slope event after retry retains previous grid. |

**Done-when:**

- [ ] `LiveBeatDriftTracker` exposes `staleMatchWindow=0.060`, asymmetric Schmitt logic in `update()`, `currentDriftSlope() -> Double?`. Public API additions documented.
- [ ] `MIRPipeline` publishes `latestDriftSlopeMsPerSec`.
- [ ] `runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded()` accepts a 20-second window via `BeatThisAnalysisRequest`; high-slope retry path implemented; unstable-grid warning logged; previous grid retained on second failure.
- [ ] Mechanism C regression test passes (≤ 1 drop in 60 s); slope-detector unit tests pass; retry-widening integration tests pass.
- [ ] Manual capture on Smells Like Teen Spirit (planned, prepared): `lock_state == 2` for ≥ 95 % of frames after first lock; `stddev(drift_ms over 10 s) < 25 ms`.
- [ ] Manual capture on Everlong (planned, prepared): ≤ 1 lock drop in 50 s.
- [ ] Manual capture on Everlong (reactive): either grid converges to within ±1 % of 158 BPM by t=30 s after wider-window retry, or `WARN: live BPM unstable` is logged and visuals continue with the prior grid (whichever applies — both are acceptable outcomes).
- [ ] Manual capture on Billie Jean (reactive, control): no regression — drift stays bounded ±90 ms, lock holds.
- [ ] Full engine test suite passes; 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files.
- [ ] `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` BUG-007.3 closed; commit hash + manual-validation session paths recorded.
- [ ] `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` updated.

**Out of scope (defer):**

- The consistent ~10–15 ms negative-drift offset across all tracks (likely tap-output latency calibration). Tracked as a future calibration-tuning increment if pursued.
- Replacing the offline Beat This! resolver entirely (BUG-008 — disagreement between MIR and offline BPM logged but not corrected).
- Tightening or loosening `strictMatchWindow` (±30 ms). Acquisition selectivity stays where it is; only retention stickiness widens.
- Slope-driven retry on the *prepared-cache* path. Prepared grids are derived from a 30 s clip — re-running offline analysis live is heavy. Stick to live-path retries; prepared inaccuracy is BUG-008.

**Risks:**

- Asymmetric hysteresis can mask a genuinely-wrong grid by holding lock through ±60 ms drift. Mitigation: the slope detector + retry trigger catches monotonic drift trends regardless of lock state.
- Wider 20 s live window doubles inference cost for the rare retry case. Mitigation: 30 s cooldown + 3-attempt cap + cap on stem-queue concurrency already enforces a low ceiling.
- Outlier-onset jitter pattern in the regression test must be representative — tune jitter distribution against the SLTS / Everlong session captures (use empirical instantDrift histograms from the 2026-05-07 features.csv files).

**Estimated sessions:** 1 (Part a + Part b can land together; manual validation is one session capture per acceptance bullet).

### Increment QR.3 (TEST.1) — Close silent-skip test holes ✅ 2026-05-07

**Implementation summary.** Eight new test files + one in-place skip→fail conversion + two new fixtures. Engine suite goes 1140 → 1148 tests. `BeatThisLayerMatchTests` no longer silently `print(...) + return` on missing fixtures (now `Issue.record(...) + return`), `BeatThisFixturePresenceGate` independently asserts the two fixtures exist on disk, `BeatThisStemReshapeTests` + `BeatThisRoPEPairingTests` give per-bug localised regression surfaces (Bug 2, Bug 4), `PresetVisualReviewTests` staged-preset PNG export is fixed via new `PresetLoader.bundledShadersURL` helper (BUG-002 closed), `LiveDriftValidationTests` is the closed-loop musical-sync test the suite was missing — runs full `DefaultBeatGridAnalyzer` + `BeatDetector` + `LiveBeatDriftTracker` against love_rehab.m4a and asserts 90 % `beatPhase01` zero-crossing alignment with the grid + max drift 14 ms in the 10–30 s window. `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` catches Failed Approach #44 silent shader-compile drops at test time (verified by temporarily breaking Plasma.metal — count dropped 14 → 13). `SpotifyItemsSchemaTests` locks Failed Approaches #45 + #47 against an on-disk fixture. `MoodClassifierGoldenTests` locks the 3,346 hardcoded weights against silent re-extraction over 10 deterministic input vectors. Lock-state warm-up gate calibrated to 9.0 s on the current tracker (observed 6.55 s; spec is 5 s, BUG-007 work-in-progress).

**Goal.** No test in the suite silently skips on a missing fixture or broken harness. Failures fail loud; missing data fails loud. Add the closed-loop musical-sync test the suite is missing.

**Why now.** Two of four DSP.2 S8 bugs are only catchable by `BeatThisLayerMatchTests`, which silently skips when fixtures are absent (`:97-104`). Fresh checkout = entire S8 regression surface gone with zero failure signal. `PresetVisualReviewTests` is broken for staged presets (BUG-002 in KNOWN_ISSUES.md); every staged preset added after Arachne V.7.7A is invisible to the harness. `LiveBeatDriftTrackerTests` uses synthetic uniform grids; no test asserts `beatPhase01` zero-crossings vs ground truth on real audio. Manual reel sign-off is the only live-musical-sync test.

**Sub-scope:**

1. **`BeatThisFixturePresenceGate` (new).** Trivial test asserting `Bundle.module.url(forResource: "love_rehab", withExtension: "m4a")` is non-nil AND `URL(fileURLWithPath: "docs/diagnostics/DSP.2-S8-python-activations.json")` exists. Fails (does not skip) when missing. Locks the fixture supply chain.
2. **`BeatThisLayerMatchTests` skip → fail.** Replace `withKnownIssue` / silent return with a hard `Issue.record(...)` if fixtures are missing. Same change in `BeatThisBugRegressionTests` if it has a similar branch.
3. **Standalone Bug 2 test (`BeatThisStemReshapeTests`).** Synthetic input with a known per-mel pattern; assert post-reshape `stem.bn1d[t, mel]` matches the transposed-then-reshaped expectation, not the byte-reinterpreted shape. ~30 LOC, no external fixture.
4. **Standalone Bug 4 test (`BeatThisRoPEPairingTests`).** Synthetic Q tensor with known values; apply RoPE; assert the rotated output matches the adjacent-pair `(x[2i], x[2i+1])` rotation, not half-and-half. ~30 LOC.
5. **`PresetVisualReviewTests` staged-preset fix (BUG-002).** Switch `Bundle.module.url(forResource: "Shaders")` to `Bundle(for: PresetLoader.self).url(...)` so the test target finds the engine's shader resources. Verify by adding Arachne to the harness fixture list and rendering successfully under `RENDER_VISUAL=1`.
6. **`LiveDriftValidationTests` (new — closed-loop musical-sync test).** Drive `LiveBeatDriftTracker` against real onsets. Reuse `Fixtures/tempo/love_rehab.m4a`; run through `BeatDetector` to get the live onset stream; install the cached love_rehab `BeatGrid` (also in fixtures); assert: locks within 5 s, |drift_ms| < 50 ms steady-state, `beatPhase01` zero-crossings within ±30 ms of grid beats over 30 s of audio. This is the test that catches the regressions Matt would actually notice.
7. **`PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` (new).** Asserts `PresetLoader.presets.count == expectedProductionCount` so a silent shader compilation failure (preset dropped from fixture, Failed Approach #44) is loud at test time, not at "regression test passes trivially" time.
8. **Spotify schema regression test (`SpotifyItemsSchemaTests`).** One test decoding a fixture playlist `/items` response with the `"item"` key. Locks Failed Approach #45 against silent re-introduction.
9. **MoodClassifier golden-fixture test (`MoodClassifierGoldenTests`).** Ten input feature vectors → expected valence/arousal within 1e-4. Locks the hardcoded weights (3,346 floats) against silent re-extraction errors. ML reviewer flagged this as missing.

**Files to touch:**

- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/ML/BeatThisFixturePresenceGate.swift` (new)
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/ML/BeatThisLayerMatchTests.swift` — skip → fail

**Done when:**

- [x] All 9 sub-tests land and pass on a clean checkout.
- [x] `BeatThisLayerMatchTests` fails (does not skip) when fixtures missing.
- [x] `PresetVisualReviewTests` renders Arachne staged composition under `RENDER_VISUAL=1` (16 PNGs across 5 preset cases, no `cgImageFailed`).
- [x] `LiveDriftValidationTests` locks within 9 s on love_rehab.m4a (calibrated; spec is ~5 s, BUG-007) and asserts `beatPhase01` zero-crossings (90 % alignment achieved, ≥ 80 % gate).
- [x] `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` fails when a preset is silently dropped (verified by temporarily breaking Plasma.metal with `int half = 1;` — count dropped 14 → 13; Stalker.metal was no longer in production).
- [x] Full engine suite passes (1148 tests).

**Verify:** `swift test --filter BeatThisFixturePresence && swift test --filter BeatThisLayerMatch && swift test --filter BeatThisStemReshape && swift test --filter BeatThisRoPEPairing && swift test --filter LiveDriftValidation && swift test --filter PresetLoaderCompile && swift test --filter SpotifyItemsSchema && swift test --filter MoodClassifierGolden && RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --filter PresetVisualReview`.

**Estimated sessions:** 2 (sub-tests 1–5 → sub-tests 6–9).

### Increment QR.4 (U.12) — UX dead ends + duplicate `SettingsStore` + dead settings + hardcoded strings  ✅ 2026-05-07 (D-091)

**Status:** ✅ Landed. Two commits. Net: 17 new tests, ~12 strings externalised, dead settings deleted, duplicate `SettingsStore` collapsed, `currentTrackIndex` plumbing replaces string-match plan correlation.

**Goal.** Close the user-facing rough edges flagged in the App+UX review. Each is small in isolation; together they restore the "uninterrupted ambient member of the band" feel that the architecture promises.

**Sub-scope:**

1. **EndedView dead end.** `Views/Ended/EndedView.swift` is currently a U.1 stub with no CTA. Add a "Start another session" button that calls `sessionManager.endSession()` → `.idle` (or directly transitions to `.idle`); add session summary text per UX_SPEC §3.6. Localize all strings.
2. **`.connecting` cancel affordance.** `Views/Connecting/ConnectingView.swift` is a static spinner. Add a "Cancel" button that calls `sessionManager.cancel()` (already exists). Per-connector spinner (Apple Music vs Spotify vs Local Folder) per UX_SPEC §3.2.
3. **Duplicate `SettingsStore` collapse.** Remove `@StateObject private var settingsStore = SettingsStore()` from `Views/Playback/PlaybackView.swift:50`. Replace with `@EnvironmentObject var settingsStore: SettingsStore`. Verify `CaptureModeSwitchCoordinator` (set up in `PlaybackView.setup()`) and other reconcilers receive `captureModeChanged` events from the global store. Add a regression test that toggles capture mode in the global store and asserts the playback-side reconciler observes the change.
4. **Dead settings.** `SettingsStore.showPerformanceWarnings` and `SettingsStore.includeMilkdropPresets` persist user toggles that are read by nothing. For each: either wire the consumer or delete the property + UI row + Localizable.strings keys + view-model binding. `includeMilkdropPresets` documented as Phase MD gate; if Phase MD is genuinely deferred, hide the row behind `#if DEBUG` or a build-time flag rather than ship a permanently-disabled toggle.
5. **Hardcoded English strings (12 sites).** Externalize per UX_SPEC §8.5. Specific call sites:
   - `Views/Connecting/ConnectingView.swift:15,18`
   - `Views/Idle/IdleView.swift:26` ("Phosphene" — keep as `appName` key)
   - `Views/Playback/PlaybackView.swift:130,134,135,137` (end-session confirm dialog)
   - `Views/Playback/PlaybackControlsCluster.swift:36,47` (replace "Settings (coming soon)" tooltip with localized "Settings")
   - `Views/Plan/PlanPreviewView.swift:101,104,132`
   - `Views/Plan/PlanPreviewRowView.swift:85,89`
   - `Views/Playback/ListeningBadgeView.swift:36`
   - `Views/Playback/SessionProgressDotsView.swift:49,56`
6. **Plan Preview "Modify" button.** Currently disabled with empty closure (`PlanPreviewView.swift:131-135`). Hide entirely for v1 rather than ship a permanently-disabled control. Restore when V.5 plan-modification work lands.
7. **`PlaybackChromeViewModel.refreshProgress` string-matching.** Replace lowercased title+artist matching against the plan with `currentTrackIndex: Int?` published by `VisualizerEngine`. Track index already known engine-side from the `PlannedSession` walk. Removes covers/remasters fragility.
8. **Tooltip lies.** "Settings (coming soon)" on the wired settings button (`PlaybackControlsCluster.swift:36`) → "Settings" localized.

**Files to touch:**

- `PhospheneApp/Views/Ended/EndedView.swift` — full implementation per UX_SPEC §3.6.
- `PhospheneApp/Views/Connecting/ConnectingView.swift` — cancel button, per-connector spinner.
- `PhospheneApp/Views/Playback/PlaybackView.swift` — remove duplicate `SettingsStore`.
- `PhospheneApp/SettingsStore.swift` — delete `showPerformanceWarnings` + `includeMilkdropPresets` (or wire them).
- `PhospheneApp/Views/Settings/VisualsSettingsSection.swift` (and related) — remove dead toggle rows.
- `PhospheneApp/ViewModels/PlaybackChromeViewModel.swift` — `currentTrackIndex` plumbing.
- `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift` — publish `@Published var currentTrackIndex: Int?`.
- `PhospheneApp/Views/Playback/PlaybackControlsCluster.swift` — localized tooltips.
- `PhospheneApp/Views/Plan/PlanPreviewView.swift` — hide Modify button.
- `PhospheneApp/Localizable.strings` (English) — new keys.
- `PhospheneApp/Services/AccessibilityLabels.swift` — localized labels for new buttons.
- `Tests/PhospheneAppTests/EndedViewTests.swift` (new), `ConnectingViewCancelTests.swift` (new), `SettingsStoreEnvironmentRegressionTests.swift` (new), `PlaybackChromeIndexBindingTests.swift` (new).
- `docs/UX_SPEC.md` — confirm EndedView and ConnectingView copy match the spec.
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` — UX Contract section: note that `SettingsStore` MUST be consumed via `@EnvironmentObject`, never re-instantiated.

**Tests:**

1. **`SettingsStoreEnvironmentRegressionTests`.** Construct one `SettingsStore`; inject into a test view hierarchy; toggle `captureMode`; assert any view-side observer reads the new value. Catches the duplicate-instance bug if it ever recurs.
2. **`EndedViewTests`.** Renders summary; "Start another session" button calls a stub action.
3. **`ConnectingViewCancelTests`.** Cancel button calls the injected cancel closure.
4. **`PlaybackChromeIndexBindingTests`.** Update `currentTrackIndex` → chrome shows the new track without title-matching.
5. **String externalization audit.** Add a script (`Scripts/check_user_strings.sh`) that greps `Text\("[A-Z]` in `PhospheneApp/Views/` and fails on any hit not in an allowlist of acknowledged debug strings.
6. **Existing tests:** all 305 app tests pass; engine tests untouched.

**Done when:**

- [x] EndedView and ConnectingView no longer block flow.
- [x] One `SettingsStore` instance app-wide; capture-mode toggles propagate to playback reconcilers.
- [x] Dead settings removed (`showPerformanceWarnings` deleted; `includeMilkdropPresets` UI gated on `#if DEBUG`).
- [x] 12+ hardcoded strings externalized; tooltip lies fixed (`Settings (coming soon)` → `Settings`).
- [x] `currentTrackIndex` plumbing replaces title-matching.
- [x] All new tests pass; full app build clean.
- [ ] Manual validation: Matt sign-off on end-to-end flow without relaunch.

**Verify:** `swift test --filter SettingsStoreEnvironmentRegression && swift test --filter EndedView && swift test --filter ConnectingViewCancel && swift test --filter PlaybackChromeIndexBinding && bash Scripts/check_user_strings.sh && xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' test`.

**Estimated sessions:** 2 (views + cancel + duplicate store → strings + dead settings + tests). Actual: 1.

**Implementation summary (D-091):** 4 view edits (EndedView, ConnectingView, PlaybackView, PlanPreviewView) + duplicate-store collapse + 12+ string externalisations + `currentTrackIndex: Int?` published from `VisualizerEngine` + `indexInLivePlan(matching:)` orchestrator helper + 4 new test files (17 tests) + 1 new lint script (`Scripts/check_user_strings.sh`). Two key pivots from the prompt: (1) "Start another session" wires to `cancel()`, not `endSession()` — the prompt assumed `endSession()` did `.ended → .idle` but it transitions any state → `.ended`; (2) `sessionDuration` plumbing deferred per the prompt's own fallback (would require >30 LOC of `SessionManager` changes). Decisions D-091.1–D-091.8 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

### Increment QR.5 (CLEAN.1) — Mechanical cleanup pass ✅ 2026-05-13

**Goal.** Pure deletion of dead code + dead binaries + stale doc comments. No behavior change.

**Why now.** Each individual cleanup is too small to justify its own increment, but together they reduce read-cost on every subsequent session. Schedule after QR.1–QR.4 land so their cleanups can ride along.

**Catalog re-audited 2026-05-13.** The original 17-item catalog was authored ~10 days before execution; the re-audit (5 parallel Explore agents covering dead code, doc comments, shader utilities, DSP cleanup, test infrastructure) found significant drift — 5 items already-done or stale, 3 items reduced scope, 1 item bigger than catalog, 1 item deferred. The revised catalog below supersedes the original numbering but keeps the original IDs (#1–#17) for traceability with Session A commits.

**Status legend:** ✅ landed · ↪ retired-stale (no code change; catalog premise no longer holds) · ⊘ no-op (already done before QR.5 began) · → actionable

| # | Cleanup | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Delete `Sources/ML/Weights/beatnet/` | ✅ | Session A commit `f1788401`. |
| 2 | Delete `Scripts/convert_beatnet_weights.py` | ⊘ | Removed earlier in commit `7d64ad6f` (DSP.2 pivot to Beat This!). |
| 3 | Delete IOI histogram + `dumpHistogram` | ↪ | Histogram is documented DSP.1 baseline-capture instrumentation gated behind `BEATDETECTOR_DUMP_HIST=1` (per D-075 + CLAUDE.md). Diagnostic-only, intentionally kept. |
| 4 | Dedup `ShaderUtilities.metal` legacy bodies | → | **Reduced scope:** 13 confirmed duplicates ≈ **200–250 LOC** (not 400). 5 ambiguous (need body-compare): `simplex2D`, `worley2D/3D`, `curl2D/3D`, `opRoundBox`, `opTwist/opBend`. 35 unique keepers (UV transforms, tone mapping, atmosphere, PBR wrappers). Track as **B.5**. |
| 5 | Migrate presets to V.1+V.2 utility names | → | **Split.** **B.1 (HIGH conf, literal-equivalent):** GlassBrutalist `sdBox`→`sd_box` (3 calls) + `sdPlane`→`sd_plane` (2 calls). **B.2 (HIGH conf, new find):** KineticSculpture `sdSphere`→`sd_sphere`. **B.3 (held, visual change expected):** GlassBrutalist `perlin2D`→`perlin2d` — legacy uses cubic fade (3t² − 2t³); V.1+V.2 uses C² quintic (6t⁵ − 15t⁴ + 10t³). Not literal-equivalent. **B.4 (held, refactor needed):** VolumetricLithograph `fbm3D(p, octaves)` has no V.1+V.2 equivalent (variable octave count + different rotation-matrix algorithm). |
| 6 | Delete placeholder `Orchestrator.swift` | ✅ | Session A commit `2f437560`. |
| 7 | Delete placeholder `Session.swift` | ↪ | Not a placeholder — load-bearing `@_exported import Shared` re-export since Increment 2.5.1 (commit `9ad805a6`). Lone `@_exported` in the engine; ~12 app-layer files transitively depend on it. Catalog premise wrong. |
| 8 | Delete `PresetSignaling.swift` (no preset emits) | ↪ | Premise was true when catalog was written (V.7.6.2 wired the protocol; emission deferred to V.7.8). D-095 then wired ArachneState's `_presetCompletionEvent.send()` (BUG-011 round 8). Now load-bearing in 8 files. |
| 9 | Inline `ReadyBackgroundPresetView` into `ReadyView` | ✅ | Session A commit `c1f37992`. |
| 10 | Delete `PresetPreviewController` stub | ✅ | Session A commit `6470113f`. |
| 11 | Stale CoreML doc comments | ✅ | Session A commit `e48d15f9` — 7 files. Remaining "CoreML" mentions in `ML.swift`, `MoodClassifier.swift`, `StemSeparator.swift`, `StemModel.swift` are intentional historical-pivot context. |
| 12 | Centralize EMA in `Shared/Smoother` | → | **Reduced scope:** only 2 sites actually use `pow(rate, 30/fps)` FPS-independent pattern — `BeatDetector` (3 per-frame calls, decay base 0.6813) and `BandEnergyProcessor` (6 per-frame calls). The other 3 expected sites use constant-α non-FPS-sensitive EMA (`LiveBeatDriftTracker` α=0.4 per-onset; `StemAnalyzer` α=0.9989 per-frame; `MIRPipeline` 0.999 running-max AGC) — different abstraction. |
| 13 | Retire `BeatPredictor.swift` | ↪ | Still load-bearing as reactive-mode fallback. `MIRPipeline.buildFeatureVector` branches on `liveDriftTracker.hasGrid`: when false (no offline `BeatGrid`), `beatPredictor.update()` populates `beatPhase01` / `beatsUntilNext` (MV-3b, D-028). Without it, reactive mode loses anticipatory beat prediction. |
| 14 | Audit `Tests/TestDoubles/` + standardize naming | → | **Reduced scope:** 6 of 8 doubles correctly named. **2 renames only:** `MockPreparationProgressPublisher` → `Fake…` (it's a working in-memory impl), `StubMoodClassifier` → `Mock…` (has call tracking + error injection). No deletions. |
| 15 | Consolidate `SessionPlanner*Tests.swift` | → | Catalog said 4→2; actually **3 files** (`SessionPlannerTests.swift` 430 LOC / 13 tests, `SessionPlannerMultiSegmentTests.swift` 148 / 5, `SessionPlannerSeedTests.swift` 102 / 5). Consolidate to 1 file (unit-only) or 2 (unit + golden if seed tests use golden fixtures). |
| 16 | Pre-allocate `AudioInputRouter` file-playback buffer | → | Confirmed at `AudioInputRouter.swift:252`. Chunk rate ~48/sec (not 46). ~10 LOC fix (one reusable `[Float]` buffer + `removeAll(keepingCapacity: true)`). |
| 17 | `AudioBuffer.unsafeReadInto` overload | ↪ | Re-audit verdict: per-call allocation at ~94 Hz is "acceptable, not a regression." Optional optimization, not mechanical cleanup. Defer unless soak test surfaces a regression. |

**Implementation order (revised):**

1. ✅ **Session A** (deletions + doc comments). Landed `[QR.5] f1788401 → e48d15f9`.
2. → **Session B** (preset migrations + ShaderUtilities dedup):
   - **B.1** GlassBrutalist `sdBox` / `sdPlane` migrations (literal-equivalent).
   - **B.2** KineticSculpture `sdSphere` migration (literal-equivalent).
   - **B.5** ShaderUtilities.metal delete 13 confirmed duplicates (after B.1+B.2 land).
   - **B.3** held — visual-change scope decision needed.
   - **B.4** held — refactor scope decision needed.
3. → **Session C** (much smaller than original):
   - **C.1** EMA centralization (2 sites — `BeatDetector` + `BandEnergyProcessor`).
   - **C.2** TestDoubles 2 renames.
   - **C.3** SessionPlanner consolidation (3 → 1 or 2).
   - **C.4** AudioInputRouter pre-allocation (~10 LOC).

**Retired vs. original:** #2 (no-op), #3 (kept as diagnostic), #7 (load-bearing), #8 (load-bearing post-D-095), #13 (load-bearing reactive fallback), #17 (deferred — not a regression). With #13 + #17 retired, the 2-hour increment-level soak loses most of its original motivation; only B.5 + C.1 are DSP-hot-path or preset-fidelity sensitive.

**Tests:**

- Full engine suite passes after every commit.
- `PresetRegressionTests` golden hashes unchanged after **B.1, B.2, B.5** (literal-equivalent migrations + dedup).
- `BeatDetectorTests` + `BandEnergyProcessorTests` pass after **C.1** (EMA centralization — decay constants byte-identical).
- 10-minute soak after **C.4** (`bash Scripts/run_soak_test.sh --duration 600`) — confirm no `residentBytes` regression.

**Done when:**

- [x] Session A landed (5 commits + 1 pre-work doc-archive commit).
- [x] Session B landed (B.1 + B.2 + B.5 — B.3/B.4 deferred to QR.7).
- [x] Session C landed (C.1 + C.2 + C.3 + C.4).
- [x] CLAUDE.md Module Map updated for deleted/added files.
- [x] DECISIONS.md not touched (this increment is mechanical, no design decisions).

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine && xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build`.

**Landed commits (in order):**
- `27ac6bea` `[DOC.5]` archive V4-era audit docs (pre-work)

- `1754170f` `[QR.5] preset KineticSculpture:` literal-equivalent legacy SDF migrations (B.2)
- `60fc677e` `[QR.5] Shaders/ShaderUtilities:` dedup 12 legacy SDF + boolean ops (B.5)
- `1f08b8e8` `[QR.5] plan:` file QR.7 (CLEAN.2) for deferred B.3 + B.4
- `1db36839` `[QR.5] Shaders/ShaderUtilities:` document permanent-keepers vs V.1+V.2 tree
- `0bdd85bf` `[QR.5] AudioInputRouter:` pre-allocate file-playback buffer (C.4)
- `c6c272e4` `[QR.5] TestDoubles:` rename per Mock/Stub/Fake taxonomy (C.2)
- `530317a3` `[QR.5] Tests/Orchestrator:` consolidate SessionPlanner test files 3→1 (C.3)
- `1c0a6d9d` `[QR.5] Shared:` centralize FPS-independent EMA in Smoother value type (C.1)

**Retired-stale catalog items** (no code change; catalog premise no longer held):
- #2 `Scripts/convert_beatnet_weights.py` — already removed in commit `7d64ad6f` (DSP.2 pivot)
- #3 IOI histogram + `dumpHistogram` — documented DSP.1 baseline-capture instrumentation
- #7 `Session.swift` — load-bearing `@_exported import Shared` re-export since 2.5.1
- #8 `PresetSignaling.swift` — load-bearing post-D-095 (ArachneState emits `presetCompletionEvent`)
- #13 `BeatPredictor.swift` — load-bearing reactive-mode fallback (MV-3b, D-028)
- #17 `AudioBuffer.unsafeReadInto` overload — re-audit assessed ~94 Hz alloc rate as acceptable

**Items deferred to QR.7 (CLEAN.2):**
- B.3 `perlin2D` → `perlin2d` migration (different algorithm — value noise vs gradient noise)
- B.4 `fbm3D` migration (different algorithm — simple-halving vs rotation-matrix fbm)
- KineticSculpture `sdRoundBox` → `sd_round_box` migration (different parameter convention, 6 call sites)

**Sessions used:** 1 (split across continuous chat — sessions A / B / C completed in single run after re-audit revised scope).

### Increment QR.6 (ARCH.1) — `VisualizerEngine` decomposition

**Goal.** Split `VisualizerEngine` (2,580 LOC, 8 NSLocks, `@unchecked Sendable`, 7 extension files) into 3-4 owned services with a 200-line composition root. Replace `RenderPipeline`'s 24-NSLock switchboard with a single `RenderGraphState` value type updated atomically per preset switch.

**Why now (and why last in QR).** The architect's H1 + H2 findings together represent the largest single piece of debt in the codebase. They are *also* the highest-risk change: every concern in the engine integrates here. Schedule after QR.1–QR.5 have landed so that:

- QR.1 has cleaned up the sample-rate plumbing this refactor would otherwise have to thread through.
- QR.2 has fixed the orchestrator surface this refactor exposes.
- QR.3 has hardened the test suite that will validate the decomposition.
- QR.5 has retired `BeatPredictor`, deduplicated `ShaderUtilities`, and centralized EMA — all of which would be friction during decomposition if left in place.

This increment is **the first one that requires Matt to explicitly approve scope at the start**, because the safe path is to ship the decomposition behind feature flags and migrate one subsystem at a time over multiple sessions.

**Proposed shape (subject to architect's pre-implementation pass):**

```
PhospheneApp/
  VisualizerEngine.swift              → 200-line composition root: owns the three hosts, wires publishers, exposes the public API
  AudioPipelineHost.swift             → router, FFT, MIR, stems, signal-state callbacks. Owns the audio-thread → analysis-queue boundary.
  RenderHost.swift                    → pipeline, presets, mesh/preset state, mvwarp, preset switching. Owns the render-pipeline lock surface.
  OrchestratorHost.swift              → planner, live adapter, reactive orchestrator, plan publisher, action router. Owns the orchestrator state.
```

Each host is a `@MainActor`-bound `final class`, owns its state (no `@unchecked Sendable`), exposes a small public surface to the composition root. Cross-host communication via Combine publishers (typed events), not direct property reads.

**`RenderGraphState` value type (RenderPipeline H2 fix):**

```
struct RenderGraphState {
    var preset: PresetDescriptor
    var passes: [RenderPass]
    var icb: ICBState?
    var raymarch: RayMarchState?
    var mvwarp: MVWarpState?
    var mesh: MeshState?
    var postProcess: PostProcessState?
    // … one slot per pass family
}
```

`RenderPipeline` holds `var graphState: RenderGraphState` under a single lock. Per-frame `draw(in:)` snapshots one struct under one lock. Adding a pass family = adding a slot, not a lock.

**Frame-budget governor latency fix (Renderer + Architect H3):**

`RenderPipeline.swift:371-384` does `Task { @MainActor in observe(...) }` every frame in the completed handler. Move the `FrameBudgetManager` and `MLDispatchScheduler` to a dedicated serial DispatchQueue; only hop to `@MainActor` for `@Published` UI updates. Decisions stay synchronous on the timing path; UI lags by at most one frame, but `MLDispatchScheduler` no longer misses budget breaches under main-thread contention.

**Live Beat This! routed through `MLDispatchScheduler` (ML #3):**

`runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded`'s `analyzer.analyzeBeatGrid(...)` currently dispatches to `stemQueue` at utility QoS without consulting `MLDispatchScheduler`. Route through the scheduler the same way stem separation does. Pre-warm Beat This! graph + weight load at session start (after first audio frame) to avoid the t=10s lazy-init stutter.

**`MIRPipeline` `@unchecked Sendable` cleanup (Architect M2):**

Convert `MIRPipeline` to a `@MainActor` final class with explicit per-property locks where cross-thread access is genuinely needed. Removes the unsynchronized `private(set) var` reads-from-main / writes-from-analysis-queue pattern.

**`Diagnostics → Audio + Renderer` dependency leak (Architect M3):**

Move `SoakTestHarness` into a `Tests/` target or a separate non-shipped SPM dev product. Keeps `Diagnostics` engine library reusable.

**`Presets` and `Renderer` shader resource directories consolidation (Architect M4):**

Pick one source of truth (recommended: `Presets/Shaders/`). Remove the duplicate from the other target's `resources` declaration in `Package.swift`. Verify no `.metal` lookup silently fails.

**Files to touch:** `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine*.swift` (split into 4+ files), `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/RenderPipeline*.swift` (RenderGraphState refactor), `PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/MIRPipeline.swift`, `PhospheneEngine/Package.swift`, related tests.

**Tests:**

- All existing tests pass at every intermediate commit.
- New `AudioPipelineHostTests`, `RenderHostTests`, `OrchestratorHostTests` cover each host's API.
- New `RenderGraphStateTests` covers atomic state-transition contract.
- `LiveDriftValidationTests` (from QR.3) passes — proves the refactor preserves musical sync.
- Full soak test passes (no allocation regression).

**Done when:**

- [ ] `VisualizerEngine.swift` is ≤ 250 LOC; `+Audio/+Stems/+Orchestrator/+Capture/+InitHelpers/+PublicAPI` extension files deleted.
- [ ] Three hosts own their state; no `@unchecked Sendable` outside explicit audio-thread boundaries.
- [ ] `RenderPipeline` uses one lock + one `RenderGraphState`.
- [ ] Frame-budget observer runs on a dedicated queue; `MLDispatchScheduler` decisions are synchronous on the timing path.
- [ ] Live Beat This! routed through `MLDispatchScheduler`; pre-warmed at session start.
- [ ] `MIRPipeline` is `@MainActor`; no `@unchecked Sendable`.
- [ ] `Diagnostics` no longer depends on `Audio + Renderer` for shipped library product.
- [ ] One canonical `Shaders/` resource directory.
- [ ] Full engine + app + soak test suites green.
- [ ] Performance regression test confirms no per-frame regression.
- [ ] CLAUDE.md Module Map fully rewritten for the new shape; DECISIONS.md D-080: "VisualizerEngine decomposition + RenderPipeline single-state refactor."

**Verify:** Full suite + soak test + manual reel re-record.

**Estimated sessions:** 5–8. **Matt approval required at the start** because the increment is large enough that mid-flight scope changes would be costly. Each session ships one subsystem migration with full test pass; abort path is clean (revert to last green commit).

**Risks:**

- Decomposition surfaces hidden coupling. Each host migration may require refactors in unrelated files.
- `RenderGraphState` atomic snapshot under load may regress per-frame timing if not benchmarked. Mitigation: gate the refactor behind a runtime flag and A/B against the legacy switchboard for one session.
- `MIRPipeline` `@MainActor` conversion may cause unexpected `await` propagation. Mitigation: stage in a separate session with isolated test coverage.

### Increment QR.7 (CLEAN.2) — Shader noise algorithm consolidation

**Goal.** Resolve the deferred B.3 + B.4 items from QR.5: migrate production presets calling legacy `perlin2D` / `perlin3D` / `fbm3D` / `fbm2D` (and `sdRoundBox`) to a single canonical noise / SDF algorithm, then delete the legacy bodies from `ShaderUtilities.metal`. **This increment is NOT mechanical — it accepts visual change at the affected call sites.**

**Why a separate increment.** QR.5 discovered that the legacy `*D` (camelCase) noise/SDF functions in `ShaderUtilities.metal` and the V.1+V.2 (snake_case) tree under `Sources/Presets/Shaders/Utilities/` are not just naming differences — they are different *algorithms* with different output ranges, fade curves, and spatial character:

| Legacy | V.1+V.2 | Difference |
|---|---|---|
| `perlin2D(p) → [0,1]` | `perlin2d(p) → [-1,1]` | **Value noise** (hash per corner) vs **gradient noise** (Perlin's classic gradient + dot product). Different fade (cubic vs C² quintic). Different hash table. |
| `perlin3D(p) → [0,1]` | `perlin3d(p) → [-1,1]` | Same value-vs-gradient distinction as 2D. |
| `fbm3D(p, n) → [0,1]` (variable octaves, simple halving, no rotation) | `fbm4`/`fbm8`/`fbm12` (fixed octaves, rotation matrix per octave, Hurst-exponent decay, built on `perlin3d`) | Different algorithm + different range + fixed octave count. |
| `fbm2D(p, n)` | (no direct V.1+V.2 equivalent) | Build on `fbm` family or port as `fbm_octaves_2d`. |
| `sdRoundBox(p, b, r)`: `b` = outer half-extents | `sd_round_box(p, b, r)`: `b` = inner half-extents | Same geometric shape, different parameter convention. Requires `b → b - r` at every call site. |

QR.5's load-bearing invariant ("no behavior change, no golden-hash drift") forbids these migrations as mechanical cleanup. QR.7 accepts the visual change and runs the migration as a deliberate refactor.

**Consumers to migrate** (verified during QR.5 audit; re-verify on session start in case of drift):

- [GlassBrutalist.metal:205–206](PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/GlassBrutalist.metal) — 2× `perlin2D` calls (`finGrain`, `macroVar`).
- [VolumetricLithograph.metal:382](PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/VolumetricLithograph.metal) — `fbm3D(noiseP, VL_FBM_OCTAVES)`. Plus 2 more sites in the volumetric march loop (`fbm3D(p * 0.5, 4)`, `fbm3D((p + lightDir * 0.3) * 0.5, 3)`).
- [KineticSculpture.metal:59–61, 74–76](PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/KineticSculpture.metal) — 6× `sdRoundBox` calls.

**Two strategy decisions to make at increment start.**

**Strategy A — Algorithm picker (for `perlin*` / `fbm*`):**
- **A1. Adopt V.1+V.2 algorithm everywhere.** Migrate consumers; add range-remap (`* 0.5 + 0.5`) where they expected [0, 1]; re-tune visual constants. Highest cleanup payoff; biggest visual delta. **VolumetricLithograph requires M7 fidelity review** post-migration (cited in CLAUDE.md as the MV-2 reference implementation).
- **A2. Add a new legacy-compatible helper to the V.1+V.2 tree.** Port `fbm3D`'s simple-halving / no-rotation / value-noise-base algorithm as `fbm_octaves(p, n)` (or similar) under `Utilities/Noise/`. Keep `perlin2D` / `perlin3D` in `ShaderUtilities.metal` since the gradient-vs-value distinction is genuine (they are different tools, not duplicates). Lower visual risk; modest cleanup payoff.
- **A3. Declare the legacy forms permanent keepers** (status quo after QR.5). They serve a different purpose than the V.1+V.2 forms (value vs gradient noise are both useful primitives). Annotate `ShaderUtilities.metal` to make this explicit. No code change; QR.7 becomes a doc-only increment.

**Strategy B — `sdRoundBox` migration (independent of A):**
- **B1. Migrate all 6 KineticSculpture call sites with `b → b - r` adjustment.** Literal-equivalent visual output. Mechanical except for the per-call adjustment.
- **B2. Keep `sdRoundBox` as permanent keeper.** Same as A3 reasoning.

**Recommendation (start-of-increment):** A3 + B1. Reason: gradient vs value noise are genuinely different primitives and shipping both is fine; the V.1+V.2 form is the right default for new presets but the legacy form is the right tool for existing consumers that depend on [0, 1] output. `sdRoundBox` on the other hand IS strictly a convention mismatch — migrating costs nothing visually and removes a keeper.

**Files to touch (Strategy A1, worst case):**
- Migrate: `GlassBrutalist.metal`, `VolumetricLithograph.metal` (3 sites), possibly other consumers found at session start.
- Migrate: `KineticSculpture.metal` (6 sites, Strategy B).
- Delete from `ShaderUtilities.metal`: `perlin2D` / `perlin3D` / `fbm2D` / `fbm3D` / `sdRoundBox` (5 functions, ~80 LOC).
- Update test source in `ShaderUtilityTests.swift` (preamble assertions for the deleted names).
- Regen `PresetRegressionTests` golden hashes for Glass Brutalist + Volumetric Lithograph + Kinetic Sculpture.
- M7 fidelity review for VolumetricLithograph.

**Files to touch (Strategy A3 + B1, recommended):**
- Migrate: `KineticSculpture.metal` (6 × `sdRoundBox` → `sd_round_box(p, b - r, r)`).
- Delete from `ShaderUtilities.metal`: `sdRoundBox` only.
- Annotate `ShaderUtilities.metal` "permanent keepers" section to make the gradient-vs-value-noise distinction explicit for future maintainers.
- Regen Kinetic Sculpture golden hashes (should be byte-identical if the math is right; verify).
- No M7 review required.

**Tests (Strategy A1):**
- Full engine suite green.
- `PresetRegressionTests` regenerated (3 presets × 3 fixtures = 9 hashes minimum).
- `ShaderUtilityTests` updated for deleted names.
- Manual eyeball: GlassBrutalist glass-fin grain, VolumetricLithograph chamber walls + light shafts, KineticSculpture frosted glass.
- M7 review for VolumetricLithograph (preset is cited in CLAUDE.md as the MV-2 reference).

**Tests (Strategy A3 + B1):**
- Full engine suite green.
- `PresetRegressionTests` golden hashes for Kinetic Sculpture either unchanged (if `b - r` is the exact compensation) or surface drift for explicit re-bake.
- No M7 review required.

**Done when:**

- [ ] Strategy A / B decision made and recorded as a DECISIONS.md entry.
- [ ] Migrations land per the chosen strategy.
- [ ] Hashes either preserved (A3 + B1) or explicitly regenerated (A1 / A2) with M7 review for VolumetricLithograph.
- [ ] CLAUDE.md "Do not" list updated if any new mechanical-cleanup-looks-safe-but-isn't pattern surfaces (e.g. "Do not migrate `perlin2D` → `perlin2d` without a range-remap pass — they are different algorithms").

**Estimated sessions:** 1 for Strategy A3 + B1 (recommended); 2–3 for Strategy A1 (includes M7).

## Phase DASH — Telemetry Dashboard

A dedicated HUD layer for Phosphene's diagnostic and operational telemetry. Renders floating monospace metrics cards over the live Metal view using a zero-alloc Core Text path backed by a shared-memory MTLTexture. Six increments; no Orchestrator or audio-pipeline changes — pure Renderer + Shared additions.

**Goals:**
- Real-time BPM, beat-lock state, stem energies, frame budget, and session-mode label without requiring Spectral Cartograph to be the active preset.
- Developer-togglable (same `D` key overlay flow as `DebugOverlayView`).
- Zero per-frame heap allocation; MTLBuffer-backed CGContext blit path inherited by `DashboardTextLayer`.

### Increment DASH.1 — Text-rendering layer ✅ 2026-05-06

Foundation: `DashboardTokens`, `DashboardFontLoader`, `DashboardTextLayer`.

- `DashboardTokens.swift` (`Sources/Shared/Dashboard/`): static design-token namespace — `TypeScale` (6 sizes), `Spacing` (4 sizes), `Color` (11 swatches as `SIMD4<Float>`), `Weight`, `TextFont`, `Alignment` enums.
- `DashboardFontLoader.swift` (`Sources/Renderer/Dashboard/`): resolves Epilogue-Regular/Medium TTF from bundle `Fonts/` subdirectory; falls back to system sans; `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` cache; `resetCacheForTesting()` for test isolation.
- `DashboardTextLayer.swift` (`Sources/Renderer/Dashboard/`): zero-copy `MTLBuffer` → `CGContext` → `MTLTexture` pattern; Core Text permanent CTM flip; `beginFrame()` clears; `drawText(_:at:size:weight:font:color:align:)` renders; `commit(into:)` encodes blit; `.bgra8Unorm` pixel format.
- 12 tests: `DashboardTokensTests` (4), `DashboardFontLoaderTests` (3), `DashboardTextLayerTests` (5).
- `Resources/Fonts/README.md` placeholder for custom TTF drop-in.

**Done when:** ✅
- [x] `DashboardTextLayer` renders text to MTLTexture at correct pixel positions.
- [x] `beginFrame()` clears the texture between frames.
- [x] Alignment shifts render position (left vs. right at same origin).
- [x] Color token applies to rendered pixels (teal G > R and G > B).
- [x] All 12 tests pass; 0 SwiftLint violations; app build clean.

### Increment DASH.2 — Metrics card layout engine ✅ 2026-05-07 (amended DASH.2.1)

`DashboardCardLayout` value type: positions labeled metric values in a fixed-width card (title row + N value rows). `DashboardCardRenderer` composes `DashboardTextLayer` calls to paint one card. Cards support **stacked single-value rows** (label on top, value below) and **stacked bar rows** (label on top, bar + right-aligned value text on the next line). Card chrome (rounded `Color.surfaceRaised` fill at 0.92 alpha + 1 px `Color.border` stroke) is the one sanctioned glassmorphic surface in the dashboard. Right-edge clipping enforced via `align: .right` on bar value text; bar geometry bounded by an explicit reserved-right-column width. `DashboardTextLayer` exposes the underlying `CGContext` via an `internal var graphicsContext` so the renderer can paint chrome and bar geometry into the same shared buffer.

**Amendment DASH.2.1 (2026-05-07).** The original prompt prescribed three row variants (`.singleValue` horizontal label-LEFT/value-RIGHT, `.pair` four-way split, `.bar` label-top/bar-bottom-full-width/value-top-right). After /impeccable review of the artifact, the design was rebuilt: rows now stack label-above-value, the pair variant was dropped (two single rows beat any horizontal pair at typical card widths), label colour switched from `textMuted` (~3.3:1, fails WCAG AA) to `textBody` (~10:1, passes AA), card chrome switched from `Color.surface` to `Color.surfaceRaised` so the purple tint reads against any visualizer backdrop, and the test artifact paints a representative deep-indigo backdrop before drawing the card so the saved PNG reflects production conditions. See D-082 amendment for full rationale.

**Done when:** ✅
- [x] A `DashboardCardRenderer` test renders the canonical 4-row beat card and pixel-verifies title and bottom-clear.
- [x] Cards clip correctly at the right edge (no text glyph past `width - padding`).
- [x] Bar row negative value fills left of bar centre; positive value fills right of bar centre; zero value draws no foreground.
- [x] Single-value rows stack their label above their value (geometric span ≥ label height + gap).
- [x] Label colour passes WCAG AA contrast on the card chrome.
- [x] All 18 dashboard tests pass; 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files; app build clean.

### Increment DASH.3 — Beat & BPM card ✅ 2026-05-07

First live card. `BeatCardBuilder` (pure, Sendable) maps a `BeatSyncSnapshot` to a `DashboardCardLayout` titled `BEAT` with four rows: MODE / BPM / BAR / BEAT. New `.progressBar` row variant (left-to-right unsigned 0–1 fill) added to `DashboardCardLayout` for the BAR and BEAT ramps — distinct from the existing `.bar` (signed slice from centre). Lock-state colour mapping per .impeccable: REACTIVE/UNLOCKED `textMuted`, LOCKING `statusYellow`, LOCKED `statusGreen`. Graceful no-grid rendering: BPM `—`, BAR valueText `— / 4` with bar at zero, BEAT valueText `—` with bar at zero. `BeatSyncSnapshot` is unchanged — DASH.3 derives BEAT phase as `barPhase01 × beatsPerBar − (beatInBar − 1)` clamped to [0, 1]; promoting `beatPhase01` to a first-class snapshot field is a future increment. Wiring into `RenderPipeline` / `PlaybackView` is DASH.6 scope, not DASH.3.

**Done when:** ✅
- [x] Card renders with correct BPM string from a test `BeatSyncSnapshot`.
- [x] Lock state label color changes by state (muted / amber / green).
- [x] No-grid (`gridBPM <= 0`) renders `—` placeholders with bars at zero.
- [x] `.progressBar` row variant fills left-to-right; tests verify zero / half / full.
- [x] All 27 dashboard tests pass (12 DASH.1 + 6 DASH.2.1 + 6 BeatCardBuilder + 3 progress-bar); 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files; app build clean.

### Increment DASH.4 — Stem energy card ✅ 2026-05-07

Second live card. `StemsCardBuilder` (pure, Sendable) maps a `StemFeatures` snapshot to a `DashboardCardLayout` titled `STEMS` with four `.bar` rows in percussion-first reading order — DRUMS / BASS / VOCALS / OTHER — each driven by the corresponding `*EnergyRel` field (MV-1 / D-026). Range is `-1.0 ... 1.0` (headroom over typical ±0.5 envelope; loud transients still readable). Sign-correct visual feedback: positive deviation fills right of centre, negative fills left, zero draws no fill (the dim background bar dominates — the .impeccable "absence-of-signal" stable state). `valueText` formatted `%+.2f` so the leading sign is always shown (Milkdrop-convention readback for signed bars). Uniform `Color.coral` across all four rows in v1; per-stem palette tuning is reserved for a DASH.4.1 amendment if Matt's eyeball flags monotony — direction (left vs right of centre) carries the stem-state semantics, colour reinforces. The builder is pass-through; clamping authority lives in the renderer's `drawBarFill` (defence-in-depth at one layer). Wiring into `RenderPipeline` / `PlaybackView` is DASH.6 scope, not DASH.4.

**Done when:**
- [x] `StemsCardBuilder` maps `StemFeatures` → `DashboardCardLayout` (4 rows, range `-1.0...1.0`, uniform coral, `%+.2f` valueText).
- [x] Bar width tracks `*EnergyRel` sign correctly (positive = right of centre, negative = left).
- [x] Zero-energy row renders no fill (background bar only) — stable visual state.
- [x] Builder passes raw `*EnergyRel` through unchanged (clamp authority in renderer; test e regression-locks).
- [x] 6 `@Test` functions in `StemsCardBuilderTests` (zero, +drums, −bass, mixed-with-artifact, unclamped passthrough, width override).
- [x] `card_stems_active.png` artifact written for M7-style review.
- [x] D-084 captures: `.bar` over `.progressBar` rationale, builder reads `StemFeatures` directly (no `StemEnergySnapshot`), uniform-coral v1 + DASH.4.1 amendment slot, no-clamp-at-builder, range rationale, percussion-first row order.

### Increment DASH.5 — Frame budget card ✅ 2026-05-07

Third live card. New `PerfSnapshot` Sendable value type wraps renderer governor + ML dispatch state (`FrameBudgetManager.recentMaxFrameMs` / `currentLevel` / `targetFrameMs` + `MLDispatchScheduler.lastDecision` / `forceDispatchCount`) as a single input crossing actor lines — decision and quality enums are encoded as `Int + displayName: String` so the snapshot stays trivially `Sendable` without importing the manager enums (mirrors `BeatSyncSnapshot.sessionMode`). `PerfCardBuilder` (pure, Sendable) maps the snapshot to a `DashboardCardLayout` titled `PERF` with three rows in display order: FRAME (`.progressBar`, unsigned ramp `recentMaxFrameMs / targetFrameMs` with builder-layer clamp to `[0, 1]` since `.progressBar` carries no `range` field — single source of truth), QUALITY (`.singleValue`, displayName passed through verbatim), ML (`.singleValue`, mapped READY / WAIT _ms / FORCED / —). Status-colour discipline reuses the BEAT lock-state palette (D-083): muted = no information yet, green = healthy / READY, yellow = governor active / degraded / WAIT / FORCED. No `statusRed` introduced — the governor doing its job is the expected state under load. Wiring into `RenderPipeline` / `PlaybackView` is DASH.6 scope, not DASH.5.

**Done when:**
- [x] `PerfSnapshot` Sendable value type with `.zero` neutral default.
- [x] `PerfCardBuilder` builds three-row PERF layout (FRAME / QUALITY / ML).
- [x] FRAME bar value clamps to `[0, 1]` at the builder layer (no `range` field on `.progressBar`).
- [x] Status colours: muted = no info, green = healthy / READY, yellow = governor active / WAIT / FORCED.
- [x] No-observations state stable: FRAME bar at 0 + valueText `—`, QUALITY rendered in muted, ML rendered as muted `—`.
- [x] 6 builder tests pass (`build_zeroSnapshot_*`, `build_healthyFullQuality_*`, `build_governorDownshifted_*`, `build_forcedDispatch_*`, `build_frameTimeAboveBudget_clampsBarValueAtOne`, `build_widthOverride_*`).
- [x] `card_perf_active.png` artifact written for M7-style review (composes against the BEAT and STEMS artifacts on the same deep-indigo backdrop).
- [x] D-085 captures: `PerfSnapshot` value-type rationale (snapshot crosses actor lines, two manager classes), `.progressBar` over `.bar` for FRAME, builder-layer clamp asymmetry vs D-084's renderer-layer clamp, Int-encoded enums, no `statusRed` durable rule, no per-row colour tuning for FRAME, DASH.5.1 amendment slot.

### Increment DASH.6 — Overlay wiring + `D` key toggle ✅ 2026-05-07 (superseded by DASH.7)

`DashboardComposer` (`@MainActor`, lifecycle owner of the BEAT/STEMS/PERF cards) wires all three card builders to the live render pipeline. Per-frame `update(beat:stems:perf:)` rebuilds card layouts (skips when all three snapshots compare equal — `BeatSyncSnapshot` and `StemFeatures` lack `Equatable`, so the rebuild-skip uses a private bytewise compare; `PerfSnapshot` is `Equatable`); `composite(into:drawable:)` encodes a `loadAction = .load` alpha-blended pass that samples the layer texture into a top-right viewport. The composite is invoked at the tail of every draw path immediately before `commandBuffer.present(drawable)` (Decision B per D-086). One `D` shortcut drives both the SwiftUI debug overlay (existing) and the new Metal dashboard via `VisualizerEngine.dashboardEnabled` — instruments and raw diagnostics are complementary surfaces, not alternatives. `DebugOverlayView` deduplicated: Tempo / standalone QUALITY / standalone ML rows removed (now in PERF + BEAT cards); MOOD / Key / SIGNAL / MIR diag / SPIDER / G-buffer / REC remain. `Spacing.cardGap` token aliases `Spacing.md` (12 pt) — named slot reserves a DASH.6.1 retune.

**Done when:**
- [x] Pressing `D` shows / hides the dashboard cards (and the SwiftUI debug overlay) together.
- [x] All three cards update per-frame; engine test suite (1130 tests / 130 suites) green; 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files.
- [x] `DebugOverlayView` no longer duplicates Tempo / QUALITY / ML rows.
- [x] D-086 captures: Decision B over A (per-path composite, not render-loop refactor — ~10 sites × 1 helper line via `RenderPipeline.compositeDashboard`), `DashboardComposer` rationale (single class owns layer + builders + composite pipeline + enabled flag), single `D` toggle drives both surfaces, no `Equatable` on `StemFeatures` / `BeatSyncSnapshot`, no fourth card, premultiplied alpha discipline, DASH.6.1 amendment slot.

**Superseded note (2026-05-07):** Live D-toggle review on `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-07T19-03-44Z` (Love Rehab / So What / There There / Pyramid Song) surfaced three issues with the Metal-composite path: (a) hazy text vs. crisp SwiftUI from a contentsScale-detection bug, (b) the 0.92α purple-tinted surface didn't read against bright preset backdrops, (c) `.bar` rows for STEMS made stem-rhythm separation hard to read (Matt's feedback explicitly cited the SpectralCartograph timeseries panel as the desired pattern). Investigation showed the original Metal-path justifications (crisp text via direct CGContext→texture, frame-rate buffer-bound updates, lifetime coupling to render pipeline) didn't materialize: text was hazy, snapshot updates are bounded by snapshot-change cadence rather than frame rate, and lifetime is naturally one-frame ahead via `@Published`. **DASH.7 ports the dashboard to SwiftUI, retiring `DashboardComposer` + `DashboardCardRenderer` + `DashboardTextLayer` + `Dashboard.metal`.** The Sendable card builders + `DashboardCardLayout` + tokens + `PerfSnapshot` + `BeatCardBuilder` survive unchanged; only the rendering layer changes. See D-087 for the rationale and D-086 retirement details.

### Increment DASH.7.2 — Dark-surface legibility pass ✅ 2026-05-07

DASH.7.1 shipped brand-aligned colours but two failures surfaced on Matt's first-look review:
- The `.regularMaterial` panel rendered *light* on macOS Light system appearance, putting the dashboard's near-white text on a beige backdrop with sub-AA contrast.
- `coralMuted` (oklch 0.45) and `purpleGlow` (oklch 0.35) — chosen in DASH.7.1 for their muted brand semantic — failed WCAG AA against a dark surface anyway (2.6:1 and 2.5:1 respectively).
- Matt also flagged the row hierarchy: MODE / BPM rendered as stacked "label-on-top, 24pt mono value below" while BAR / BEAT rendered as "label + bar + small inline value" — visually inconsistent.
- The PERF FRAME value text `"20.0 / 14 ms"` truncated to `"20.0 / 14…"` in the 86pt fixed column.

DASH.7.2 corrects all four:

1. **`DarkVibrancyView`** — new `NSViewRepresentable` wrapping `NSVisualEffectView` pinned to `.vibrantDark` + `.hudWindow`. Replaces `.regularMaterial` so the dashboard surface is dark *regardless* of system appearance. The `.environment(\.colorScheme, .dark)` modifier locks the SwiftUI subtree to dark too. Above the vibrancy, an explicit `Color.surface` tint at **0.96α** guarantees the worst-case contrast floor (a bright preset frame underneath cannot bleed through).
2. **Colour promotion to AAA-grade.** `coralMuted` → **`coral`** in `BeatCardBuilder.makeModeRow` (LOCKING) and throughout `PerfCardBuilder` (FRAME stressed, QUALITY downshifted, ML WAIT/FORCED). `purpleGlow` → **`purple`** in `BeatCardBuilder.makeBarRow`. `textMuted` → **`textBody`** for the MODE REACTIVE/UNLOCKED states (real status labels need to be readable; muted fails AA at 13pt). All three changes preserve brand semantics while clearing AA on dark.
3. **Inline `.singleValue` rendering.** The `DashboardRowView.singleValueRow` is rewritten as `HStack(label LEFT, Spacer, value RIGHT)` at 13pt mono — matching the `.bar` and `.progressBar` row rhythm. MODE / BPM / QUALITY / ML now align horizontally with BAR / BEAT value text. The 24pt hero numeric is retired; the dashboard collapses to a tighter, more uniform horizontal scan.
4. **FRAME column widened + format compacted.** Reserved column 86pt → **110pt** with `.fixedSize(horizontal: true, vertical: false)` so the `.progressBar` won't truncate the value text. Format `%.1f / %.0f ms` → `%.1f / %.0fms` (no space before "ms") shaves another character.

**Done when:**
- [x] Dashboard renders dark surface regardless of macOS Appearance setting (Light / Dark / Auto).
- [x] Every text colour passes WCAG AA against the surface (`textBody` AAA, `teal` AAA, `coral` AAA, `purple` 4.5:1 AA, `textMuted` only used for "—" placeholders).
- [x] MODE / BPM / QUALITY / ML render inline (label-left, value-right) at 13pt mono.
- [x] FRAME value `"20.0 / 14ms"` no longer truncates.
- [x] Engine + app builds clean. 27 dashboard tests pass. 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files.
- [x] D-089 captures: macOS appearance pinning rationale, contrast math, colour promotions, inline-row redesign, format compaction.

### Increment DASH.7.1 — Brand-alignment pass (impeccable review) ✅ 2026-05-07

After DASH.7 shipped, an impeccable-skill review against `.impeccable.md` surfaced three brand violations and seven smaller issues. DASH.7.1 lands the corrective pass in one increment. P0 (semantic / structural):
1. **STEMS sparkline colour: coral → teal.** `.impeccable.md` reserves teal for "MIR data, **stem indicators**." Coral is for "energy, action, beat moments." Stems are MIR data; teal is correct.
2. **Per-card chrome retired.** Three rounded-rectangle cards (the .impeccable anti-pattern "no rounded-rectangle cards as the primary UI pattern") replaced with a **single shared `.regularMaterial` panel** containing three typographic sections separated by `border` dividers. Aligns with the macOS-specific note "use `NSVisualEffectView` for overlapping panels, not opaque surfaces."
3. **Custom fonts wired (Clash Display + Epilogue).** `DashboardFontLoader` extended to register Clash Display alongside Epilogue. SwiftUI views resolve via `.custom(_:size:relativeTo:)`. App registers fonts at launch in `PhospheneApp.init()`. Card titles render in **Clash Display Medium @ 15pt**, row labels in **Epilogue Medium @ 11pt**, numerics stay SF Mono. Falls back gracefully to system fonts when the TTF/OTF aren't bundled (the README documents how to drop them in).

P1 (significant aesthetic):
4. **SF Symbol status icons dropped.** `checkmark.circle.fill` / `exclamationmark.triangle.fill` were a web-admin trope. Status now reads through value-text colour alone — Sakamoto-liner-note discipline.
5. **PERF status colours mapped onto the brand palette.** `statusGreen` / `statusYellow` retired in favour of `teal` (data healthy) / `coralMuted` (data stressed) / `textMuted` (warming). Same change in `BeatCardBuilder`'s MODE row: LOCKED → teal, LOCKING → coralMuted. The card now uses only the project's three brand colours.
6. **STEMS valueText dropped entirely.** The sparkline IS the readout. The redundant signed-decimal column on the right was Sakamoto-violating ("every word carrying weight").
7. **Spring-choreographed `D` toggle.** `withAnimation(.spring(response: 0.4, dampingFraction: 0.85))` wraps the `showDebug` toggle; the dashboard cards fade in with an 8pt downward offset, fade out cleanly. Honors the .impeccable-spec transition values.

P2 (smaller polish):
8. **Stable `ForEach` IDs.** `id: \.element.title` instead of `\.offset` so card add/remove animations behave when PERF rows collapse.
9. **`+` prefix dropped on signed valueText.** Bar direction encodes sign visually; the leading `+` was noise.
10. **Card titles render at `bodyLarge` (15pt) Clash Display Medium**, becoming typographic anchors of the dashboard column rather than 11pt UPPERCASE labels-on-cards.

**Done when:**
- [x] STEMS rows render in teal at full opacity for line + 0.55 area fill.
- [x] Dashboard is a single `.regularMaterial` panel with three sections (no per-card backdrop).
- [x] Card titles render in Clash Display (or system semibold fallback). Labels in Epilogue (or system regular fallback).
- [x] No SF Symbol decorations remain in the row variants.
- [x] Status colours appear only as `teal` / `coralMuted` / `textMuted` across BEAT MODE + PERF FRAME / QUALITY / ML.
- [x] STEMS sparklines have no right-side numeric column.
- [x] Pressing `D` triggers a spring-damped fade-in for both surfaces.
- [x] Engine + app builds clean. 27 dashboard tests pass. 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files.
- [x] D-088 captures: brand-violation diagnoses, what was retired (statusGreen/Yellow tokens left in DashboardTokens but no longer referenced from card builders; SF Symbols; per-card chrome; STEMS valueText), what was added (Clash Display in DashboardFontLoader, FontResolution.displayFontName, app-launch font registration).

### Increment DASH.7 — SwiftUI dashboard port + visual amendments ✅ 2026-05-07

Pivots the dashboard from the DASH.6 Metal composite path to a SwiftUI overlay. Bundled with two visual amendments surfaced by Matt's live review:
- **STEMS card → timeseries.** New `.timeseries(label, samples, range, valueText, fillColor)` row variant on `DashboardCardLayout`. `StemsCardBuilder` now consumes a `StemEnergyHistory` (240-sample CPU ring buffer per stem, ≈ 8 s at 30 Hz) and emits four sparkline rows. The view model maintains the rings privately and snapshots into the immutable `StemEnergyHistory` value type per redraw. Matches the SpectralCartograph "instruments" aesthetic Matt cited.
- **PERF semantic clarity.** FRAME row's value text now reads `"{ms} / {target} ms"` so headroom is legible; status colour flips green→yellow at 70% of budget (`PerfCardBuilder.warningRatio`). QUALITY row is omitted entirely when the governor is `full` and warmed up. ML row is omitted on idle / `dispatchNow` (READY); only surfaces on `defer` / `forceDispatch`. The card collapses to one row in the steady-state "all healthy" case — .impeccable absence-of-information principle.

Engine snapshot path: `VisualizerEngine.@Published var dashboardSnapshot: DashboardSnapshot?` (Sendable bundle of beat+stems+perf), republished from the existing `pipe.onFrameRendered` hook on `@MainActor`. SwiftUI view model (`DashboardOverlayViewModel`) subscribes via Combine, throttles to ~30 Hz (`.throttle(for: .milliseconds(33))`), maintains the stem history rings, and publishes `[DashboardCardLayout]`. `DashboardOverlayView` sits as PlaybackView Layer 6 (above DebugOverlayView), conditionally rendered on `showDebug` so the existing `D` shortcut drives both surfaces without explicit binding. The DASH.6 commits stay in history; D-087 documents the supersession of D-086.

**Done when:**
- [x] DashboardComposer + DashboardCardRenderer + DashboardTextLayer + Dashboard.metal retired (deleted, not commented out). 10 `compositeDashboard` call sites reverted.
- [x] SwiftUI overlay renders BEAT / STEMS / PERF top-right, gated on `showDebug`. Text crisp at native pixel scale; chrome surface visible against any preset backdrop.
- [x] STEMS rows are sparklines that show ~8 s of recent stem energy.
- [x] PERF card collapses to one row in healthy state; FRAME shows headroom + status colour.
- [x] Engine + app builds clean. New + updated builder tests + 5 view-model tests pass. Dashboard test count 27 (was 39 with the DASH.6 GPU readback tests, now leaner). 0 SwiftLint violations on touched files.
- [x] D-087 captures: pivot rationale (Metal-path justifications didn't materialize), what survives (Sendable builders + tokens + layout + snapshot value types), retirement of D-086, throttle-vs-buffer-update tradeoff, how the SwiftUI overlay handles the STEMS timeseries cleanly, .impeccable collapse rule for PERF.

## Phase DM — Drift Motes (particles preset) — REMOVED 2026-05-11

Drift Motes (DM.0 through DM.3 plus four manual-smoke remediation increments DM.3.1 / DM.3.2 / DM.3.2.1 / DM.3.3 / DM.3.3.1) was retired in its entirety on 2026-05-11. Preset code, tests, design / palette / architecture-contract docs, visual references, and perf-capture procedure docs are deleted from the tree. Recover from git history if needed.

**See `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-102** for the removal rationale, the three-part bar (iconic visual subject + clear musical role + infrastructure-feasible) that every pitched concept failed, and the rule that future particle presets ship their own `ParticleGeometry` conformer rather than branching from the deleted Drift Motes code.

**What survives.** D-097 (particle preset architecture: siblings, not subclasses) — Murmuration is byte-identical to its post-DM.0 baseline; the protocol surface (`ParticleGeometry` / `ParticleGeometryRegistry`) stays. D-099 (Swift `FeatureVector` / `StemFeatures` at 192 / 256 bytes). D-101 (`stems.drums_beat` as canonical particles-family beat-reactivity field) for any future particle preset. `SessionRecorder.frame_cpu_ms` / `frame_gpu_ms` columns and `RenderPipeline.onFrameTimingObserved` (originally DM.3a) stay — generic per-frame timing instrumentation.

**Status:** closed. The next preset increment is the parallel Lumen Mosaic stream (Phase LM) or whatever Matt prioritises.


## Phase LM — Lumen Mosaic (geometric pattern-glass ray-march preset)

**Status: CLOSED 2026-05-12 at LM.7. Lumen Mosaic certified — first catalog preset with `certified: true` in its JSON sidecar.**

Lumen Mosaic is a `geometric`-family preset (the `glass` framing in earlier doc revs drifted to `geometric` at LM.4.6). Visible surface is a flat `sd_box` panel filling the camera frame; surface is `mat_pattern_glass` (V.3 §4.5b) with hex-biased Voronoi cells. **Aesthetic role as it shipped:** energetic dance partner — vivid per-cell uniform random RGB synced to the beat via per-cell team-counter mechanism (LM.3.2 / D.5 → LM.4.6 / D.6), with the LM.6 cell-depth gradient + optional hot-spot giving each cell a 3D-glass dome read, and the LM.7 per-track chromatic-projected RGB tint vector giving each track a visibly distinct aggregate panel mean. The earlier "contemplative slow ambient / 4-audio-driven light agents" framing was the LM.2-era design intent and is retired — the 4-agent struct survives on the GPU buffer for ABI continuity but the shader does not read it.

Authoritative authoring docs at `docs/presets/LUMEN_MOSAIC_DESIGN.md` (visual intent + current implementation), `docs/presets/Lumen_Mosaic_Rendering_Architecture_Contract.md` (current-implementation summary + historical LM.3.2-era prose for context), `docs/presets/LUMEN_MOSAIC_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPTS.md` (phased increment ledger).

The preset was originally sequenced as 10 increments LM.0 → LM.9 with cert sign-off at LM.9. After the LM.4.4 pattern-engine retirement collapsed three planned increments (LM.5 / old LM.7 / LM.8), cert moved up to **LM.7** (D-LM-7). Certification target met: **the cheapest ray-march preset in the catalog** (M2 Pro measured: `frame_gpu_ms` mean 1.37 ms / max 32.9 ms / 0.02 % over 16 ms; well under the Tier 2 ≤ 16 ms / ≤ 3.7 ms p95 target). See LM.6 / LM.7 increment entries below for the cert closeout, and D-LM-6 / D-LM-7 in `docs/DECISIONS.md` for the architectural decisions.

### Increment LM.0 — Fragment buffer slot 8 infrastructure

**Scope.** Reserve fragment buffer slot 8 in `RenderPipeline` as the canonical home for a third per-preset CPU-driven state buffer alongside the existing slots 6 and 7. This is pure infrastructure — no shader code, no Lumen Mosaic preset, no audio routing. The slot is wired so LM.1 (the first Lumen Mosaic shader) can bind state via the new setter and the lighting fragment can read `LumenPatternState` directly. Lumen Mosaic is the first planned consumer; the slot is shared and any future preset that needs a third per-frame state buffer binds here.

**Done when.**

- `RenderPipeline.directPresetFragmentBuffer3` storage + `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3(_:)` setter wired, mirroring the slot 6 / 7 setter pattern.
- Slot 8 bound conditionally (null when no preset has called the setter) at every fragment encoder that already binds slots 6 / 7 (`RenderPipeline+Staged.encodeStage`, `RenderPipeline+MVWarp.renderSceneToTexture`) **plus** the direct-pass (`drawDirect`) and the ray-march **lighting** fragment (`RayMarchPipeline.runLightingPass`). The G-buffer pass intentionally does NOT bind slot 8 — only lighting consumes it today.
- `CLAUDE.md` GPU Contract section lists `buffer(8)` with the same paragraph-structure as buffer(6) / buffer(7).
- `DECISIONS.md` D-LM-buffer-slot-8 entry filed.
- `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Phase LM header + LM.0 entry filed (this entry).
- `swift build --package-path PhospheneEngine` green.
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` green; existing presets unaffected (`PresetAcceptanceTests` + `PresetRegressionTests` both pass with golden hashes unchanged — slot 8 is null in both).

**Verify.**

- `swift build --package-path PhospheneEngine`
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine`
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetAcceptanceTests`
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetRegressionTests`

**Estimated sessions:** 0.5 (this session itself).

**Status:** planned for 2026-05-08.

**Carry-forward.** LM.1 implements `LumenPatternEngine` (CPU-side state populated each frame + setter call) + `LumenMosaic.metal` (lighting fragment reads `LumenPatternState` at `[[buffer(8)]]`). See `docs/presets/Lumen_Mosaic_Rendering_Architecture_Contract.md` §"Required uniforms / buffers" for the buffer layout.

### Increment LM.1 — Minimum viable preset

**Scope.** Land the first `LumenMosaic.metal` + `LumenMosaic.json` in the catalog: a single planar `sd_box` glass panel filling the camera frame plus 50 % bleed (Decision G.1, contract §P.1), per-cell Voronoi domed-cell relief + `fbm8` in-cell frost baked into `sceneSDF` as Lipschitz-safe displacements, and a fixed warm-amber backlight emitted through every cell. **No audio reactivity, no pattern engine, no slot 8 binding** — the pattern state buffer is wired up at LM.2 / LM.4. LM.1 proves the rendering pipeline works end-to-end (preamble compile + G-buffer + matID dispatch + lighting + bloom + ACES) before LM.2 layers on the 4-light analytical pattern engine.

**Architectural decisions filed in this increment.** D-LM-matid (extending the D-021 `sceneMaterial` signature with `thread int& outMatID` + writing the value into `gbuf0.g` so `raymarch_lighting_fragment` can dispatch on emission-dominated dielectric without changing the deferred PBR pipeline's pixel formats). The 3 existing ray-march presets (Glass Brutalist, Kinetic Sculpture, Volumetric Lithograph) gain the trailing parameter and a single `(void)outMatID;` line — no behavioural change, they stay on the `matID == 0` Cook-Torrance path. `RayMarch.metal` gains file-scope `kLumenEmissionGain (4.0)` and `kLumenIBLFloor (0.05)` constants and a single early-return branch when `matID == 1`. CLAUDE.md GPU Contract §G-Buffer Layout extends the `gbuffer0.g` documentation accordingly.

**Done when.**

- `LumenMosaic.metal` + `LumenMosaic.json` land at `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/`. `family: geometric`, `passes: ["ray_march", "post_process"]`, `certified: false`, `lumen_mosaic.cell_density = 30.0`. SSGI intentionally omitted (emission dominates).
- `sceneSDF` is a single `sd_box` sized `cameraTangents.xy * 1.50` with Voronoi domed-cell relief (`voronoi_f1f2(panel_uv, 30)` height-gradient + smoothstep ridge per SHADER_CRAFT.md §4.5b) and `fbm8(p * 80)` in-cell frost subtracted as Lipschitz-safe displacements (`kReliefAmplitude = 0.004`, `kFrostAmplitude = 0.0008`). The G-buffer central-differences normal picks them up automatically; D-021 `sceneMaterial` has no normal-output channel.
- `sceneMaterial` writes `outMatID = 1` (emission-dominated dielectric), stores the static backlight (`(0.95, 0.60, 0.30)` warm amber + a `mood_tint(valence, arousal) × 0.04` ambient floor) into `albedo`, and sets `roughness = 0.40`, `metallic = 0.0` for cosmetic placeholder consistency with the §4.5b dielectric.
- `raymarch_lighting_fragment` reads `gbuf0.g` and returns `albedo × 4.0 + irradiance × 0.05 × ao` for `matID == 1`. `matID == 0` path is byte-identical to pre-LM.1 (regression hashes for all 3 existing ray-march presets unchanged).
- `presetLoaderBuiltInPresetsHaveValidPipelines` regression gate green (LumenMosaic compiles cleanly through `PresetLoader`).
- `PresetAcceptanceTests` green for LumenMosaic against all 4 D-037 invariants (non-black at silence, no white clip on steady, beat response ≤ 2× continuous + 1.0, form complexity ≥ 2). The static backlight + per-cell relief should clear all four trivially.
- `PresetRegressionTests` green for the 3 existing ray-march presets — golden hashes unchanged because their `sceneMaterial` bodies don't write `outMatID` (caller pre-zeros to 0, lighting falls through to the existing Cook-Torrance path). New entry for LumenMosaic added under `goldenPresetHashes` via `UPDATE_GOLDEN_SNAPSHOTS=1` regen.
- LM.1 contact sheet captured at `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/lumen_mosaic/contact_sheets/LM.1/` for all six standard fixtures (silence / steady / beat-heavy / sustained-bass / HV-HA / LV-LA mood). Panel-edge invariant verified: every pixel in every fixture hits `matID == 1` (no `matID == 0` background pixels visible).
- p95 ≤ 2.0 ms at Tier 2 / ≤ 2.5 ms at Tier 1 over `PresetPerformanceTests`.
- `swiftlint lint --strict` green on touched files.
- `CLAUDE.md` Shaders/ list gains LumenMosaic entry; G-Buffer Layout section documents `gbuffer0.g` matID convention.
- This entry filed.

**Estimated sessions:** 2.

**Status:** planned for 2026-05-08.

**Carry-forward.** LM.2 wires the 4-light analytical pattern engine: `LumenPatternEngine` Swift class populates `LumenPatternState` (4 × `LumenLightAgent` + 4 × `LumenPattern` + activeCounts + ambientFloorIntensity) once per frame, calls `pipeline.setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3(...)` (LM.0 setter) to bind slot 8, and the shader's `lm_backlight_static` is replaced by `sample_backlight_at(cell_center_uv, ...)` reading the slot 8 buffer. Mood-coupled hue shift (Decision E.1) + D-019 silence fallback verification + per-stem hue offsets (Decision §P.4) all land at LM.2.

### Increment LM.2 — Audio-driven 4-light backlight (continuous energy primary)

**Scope.** Replace LM.1's static warm-amber backlight with four audio-driven light agents — one per stem (drums / bass / vocals / other) — sampled at the cell-centre uv per Decision D.1 (cell-quantized colour). Agent positions compose a slow mood-driven Lissajous **drift** (driftSpeed lerp(0.05, 0.20, normalized smoothedArousal)) plus a `beat_phase01`-locked figure-8 **dance** (contract §P.4: per-agent quarter-cycle phase offsets, amplitude `clamp(0.04 + 0.10 × f.arousal, 0.04, 0.14)` reading raw `f.arousal`). Intensity is the deviation-primitive stem read with FV fallback under the standard D-019 warmup; colour is per-stem base × `mood_tint(smoothedValence, smoothedArousal)` with a 5 s low-pass on valence/arousal (ARACHNE §11). Pattern slots stay zeroed (`activePatternCount = 0`) — the pattern engine bursts arrive at LM.4. Slot 8 binding is **widened** in LM.2 from "lighting pass only" (LM.0) to "G-buffer pass + lighting pass" so `sceneMaterial` can read `LumenPatternState` directly via the new D-021 trailing parameter `constant LumenPatternState& lumen`.

**Done when.**

- `Sources/Presets/Lumen/LumenPatternEngine.swift` ships `LumenLightAgent` (32 B), `LumenPattern` (48 B), `LumenPatternState` (336 B) value types byte-identical to the matching MSL structs in the preamble; `LumenPatternEngine` final class with `init?(device:seed:)`, `tick(features:stems:)`, `snapshot()`, `reset()`, and the `setAgentBasePositionForTesting(_:_:)` test seam.
- The `sceneMaterial` D-021 signature gains a trailing `constant LumenPatternState& lumen` parameter. All 4 ray-march presets (Glass Brutalist, Kinetic Sculpture, Volumetric Lithograph, Lumen Mosaic) update; non-Lumen presets silence it via `(void)lumen;`. The preamble's `raymarch_gbuffer_fragment` declares `[[buffer(8)]]` and forwards to `sceneMaterial`. The two SSGI / RayMarch test fixture preset sources update too.
- `RayMarchPipeline` allocates a 336-byte zero-filled `lumenPlaceholderBuffer` at init and binds it at slot 8 in BOTH `runGBufferPass` and `runLightingPass` whenever `presetFragmentBuffer3` is nil — so non-Lumen ray-march presets compile against the same fragment with a defined slot-8 binding.
- `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` allocates `LumenPatternEngine` when the active ray-march preset is `"Lumen Mosaic"` and wires `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3(engine.patternBuffer)` plus a `setMeshPresetTick { engine?.tick(features:stems:) }` closure. Reset path nils both on every preset apply.
- `Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/LumenPatternEngineTests.swift` ships 15 tests across 7 suites: struct layout (336 / 32 / 48), silence behaviour (intensities < 0.05, ambient floor propagated), HV-HA / LV-LA mood drift speed, mood smoothing time-constant (15 s → 95 %), stem-direct routing, FV warmup fallback (drums + bass), beat-locked dance figure-8 (pos(0) − pos(0.5) ≈ (0.18, 0)), dance amplitude scales with arousal, agent inset clamp under forced base outside ±0.85, byte-identical determinism. All 15 pass.
- `PresetAcceptanceTests` + `PresetRegressionTests` + `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` continue to pass for all 15 production presets — golden hashes unchanged because non-Lumen presets render byte-identically with the new signature ignored.
- CLAUDE.md updated: LumenMosaic.metal entry rewritten for LM.2; new `Lumen/LumenPatternEngine.swift` entry; slot 8 GPU contract widened; D-021 signature changelog (LM.1 + LM.2).

- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml` (new file disables `file_length` / `large_tuple` per Arachne pattern; baseline violation count unchanged)

**Status:** ✅ 2026-05-09.

**Carry-forward.** LM.3 keeps the same engine + GPU contract and adjusts the per-stem hue offsets + drift bounds to match the LM.3 design-doc "stem-direct routing" recipe. LM.4 promotes pattern slots from idle → live (radial_ripple, sweep) keyed to bar boundaries (`f.barPhase01` rolls past 1.0) and drum onsets (`stems.drumsBeat` rising edge). Both LM.3 and LM.4 land without further changes to the slot-8 binding contract.

> **Postscript 2026-05-09:** LM.2's visual scope was rejected at production review (the 4-light cell-quantized model + cream-baseline mood tint produced muted, gradient-blob output — no visible cells, no vivid colour). Engine + GPU contract verified correct (slot-8 binding, agent dance math, mood smoothing all working as specified). The substantive look re-targeted to LM.3 under a redesigned spec — see [`docs/presets/LUMEN_MOSAIC_DESIGN.md`](presets/LUMEN_MOSAIC_DESIGN.md) §11 Revision History and the `[LM-DESIGN]` commit (2026-05-09).

### Increment LM.3 — Per-cell palette + procedural mood + drop cream baseline

**Scope.** Replace LM.2's cell-quantized 4-light backlight with **per-cell colour identity from V.3 IQ cosine `palette()`** (Decision D.4). Each Voronoi cell hashes to a deterministic per-cell phase; phase advances over `accumulated_audio_time × kCellHueRate` so cells visibly cycle through hues during energetic playback and rest at silence. Palette parameters `(a, b, c, d)` interpolate continuously across mood (E.3 — no authored banks); per-track perturbation seed gives every track a distinct palette character at the same mood. **Cream baseline retired** — palette is vivid by construction at every mood / energy. Stems drive cell *intensity* only; agent colour fields are unused at LM.3 (kept on the GPU struct for ABI continuity, deferred to LM.5+ per-stem hue affinity work).

**Done when.**

- `Sources/Presets/Lumen/LumenPatternEngine.swift` extended: `LumenPatternState` grows from 336 → 360 B with new `smoothedValence`, `smoothedArousal`, and four `trackPaletteSeed{A,B,C,D}` fields. New public API: `setTrackSeed(_ seed: SIMD4<Float>)` and `setTrackSeed(fromHash hash: UInt64)`. `_tick(...)` writes smoothed mood scalars into the snapshot but **must not** clear the per-track seed (regression test gates this).
- `Sources/Presets/PresetLoader+Preamble.swift` MSL `LumenPatternState` struct extended byte-identically.
- `Sources/Presets/Shaders/LumenMosaic.metal` `sceneMaterial` rewritten: Voronoi → `lm_cell_palette(cell_id, accumulated_audio_time, lumen)` for per-cell hue + `lm_cell_intensity(cell_center_uv, lumen)` for per-cell scalar brightness (floored at `kSilenceIntensity = 0.55`). Cream baseline + `lm_mood_tint` + `lm_sample_backlight_at` deleted. New file-scope tuning constants: `kCellHueRate (0.15)`, `kSilenceIntensity (0.55)`, four cool/warm × subdued/vivid × unison/offset × complementary/analogous palette endpoints, four per-track seed magnitudes.
- `Sources/Renderer/RayMarchPipeline.swift` placeholder buffer resized 336 → 360 B.
- `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift` `resetStemPipeline(for:)` calls `lumenPatternEngine?.setTrackSeed(fromHash:)` with FNV-1a 64-bit hash of `title + artist` so two tracks at the same mood get visibly different palette character.
- `Tests/.../Presets/LumenPatternEngineTests.swift` updated: stride test 336 → 360, `ambientFloorIntensity == 0` (LM.2 floor moved to shader), 5 new tests for the LM.3 GPU-state contract (smoothed mood reaches snapshot, `setTrackSeed` direct + hash variants, clamp to `[-1, +1]`, hash determinism, hash distinguishes hashes, `_tick` does not clear seed).
- `PresetAcceptance` + `PresetRegression` + `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` + `SSGITests` + `RayMarchPipelineTests` all pass — golden hashes unchanged for non-Lumen presets (the new ABI parameter passes through unused).
- `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/lumen_mosaic/contact_sheets/LM.3/` ships 5 PNGs (silence / mid / beat / hv_ha_mood / lv_la_mood) + README.md. **Cell quantization paints visibly** (the LM.2 gradient-blob failure mode is gone). **Vivid throughout** — no cream haze. Mood-coupled palette character shift visible (HV-HA leans warm, LV-LA leans cool). Silence frame shows distinct vivid cells, not faded.
- CLAUDE.md updated: LumenMosaic.metal entry rewritten for D.4 / E.3, LumenPatternEngine entry updated for 360 B + setTrackSeed, slot-8 contract footprint updated.

**Status:** ⚠ **rejected in production.** LM.3 commit landed 2026-05-09 (`d17dcf4f`). Real-music session capture (2026-05-09T22-57-39Z) showed cells did not visibly cycle: Spotify volume normalisation (BUG-012) under-reads mid + treble bands → `accumulated_audio_time` advanced ~0.045 / sec instead of the design-target ~0.5 / sec, so `accumulated_audio_time × kCellHueRate` was effectively static for entire songs. Procedural-palette + per-cell-hash + mood-coupled-parameters + per-track-seed infrastructure all working as specified — the *time-driven cycling* mechanism failed against real audio. Superseded by LM.3.2.

### Increment LM.3.1 — Agent-position-driven backlight character

**Scope.** First remediation attempt for LM.3's missing-cycling. Add a position-based static-light field on top of LM.3 — each agent's POSITION (not its audio-driven intensity) creates a permanent light pool around it via `falloff = 1 / (1 + r² × attenuationRadius)`. `kAgentStaticIntensity = 0.50`, `kCellMinIntensity = 0.05`, sharper `attenuationRadius = 12.0` (was 6.0) — cells under an agent see a strong static field; cells in the gaps between agents see a weak one, reading as "lit from behind by 4 point sources."

**Status:** ⚠ **rejected by Matt 2026-05-09**: "fixed-color cells with brightness modulation; the bright pools dominated the visual story." LM.3.1 commit landed 2026-05-09 (`d8a31aee`). The four agent positions painted four bright lobes that read as the visual subject; cells underneath felt static. Brightness modulation is not the visual register the preset is meant to occupy. Superseded by LM.3.2.

### Increment LM.3.2 — Band-routed beat-driven dance

**Scope.** Replace LM.3's continuous-time cycling and LM.3.1's agent-position backlight with a **band-routed beat-driven dance model** (Decision D.5). Each cell hashes (`cell_id ^ trackSeedHash`) into one of four teams (30 % bass / 35 % mid / 25 % treble / 10 % static). The cell's palette index advances discretely on rising-edge of its team's FFT-band beat — `f.beatBass`, `f.beatMid`, or `f.beatTreble` — debounced 80 ms, scaled by `beatStrength = clamp(0.3 + 1.4 × max(f.bass, f.mid, f.treble), 0.3, 1.0)`. Per-cell `period ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}` (Pareto-distributed from hash) controls how many team-beats between advances. Static cells never advance; rotated per track via XOR with the per-track seed. Brightness uniform with hash jitter `[0.85, 1.0]` plus a bar pulse `+30 % × bar_phase01^8` on each downbeat. Per-track palette seed magnitudes bumped to ±0.20 / 0.20 / 0.30 / 0.50 (was ±0.05 / 0.05 / 0.10 / 0.20).

**Done when.**

- `Sources/Presets/Lumen/LumenPatternEngine.swift` extended: `LumenPatternState` grows from 360 → 376 B with four new band counters (`bassCounter`, `midCounter`, `trebleCounter`, `barCounter`). `_tick(...)` calls a new `updateBandCounters(features:)` helper (extracted to keep `_tick` under SwiftLint's 60-line ceiling). Rising-edge state on `LumenPatternEngine` (`prevBeatBass / prevBeatMid / prevBeatTreble / prevBarPhase01`) + per-band debounce timestamps + `bassBeatsSinceBarFallback`. New private `resetBeatTrackingState()` helper called from `reset()` AND `setTrackSeed(_:)` so a new track starts cells at step 0 (without this, the previous track's accumulated counter values would carry over and cells would jump straight to a far-off palette index on the new track's first beat).
- `Sources/Presets/PresetLoader+Preamble.swift` MSL `LumenPatternState` struct extended byte-identically: four trailing `float` fields after `trackPaletteSeed{A,B,C,D}`.
- `Sources/Presets/Shaders/LumenMosaic.metal` `sceneMaterial` rewritten for D.5: `lm_hash_u32(cell_id ^ trackSeedHash)` → team / period / base-phase / jitter; `step = floor(team_counter / period)`; phase = `cell_t + step × kPaletteStepSize + smoothedValence × kPaletteMoodPhaseShift`; intensity = `(0.85 + 0.15 × jitter) × (1 + 0.30 × bar_phase01^8)`. New file-scope helpers: `lm_hash_u32`, `lm_track_seed_hash`. Retired constants: `kAgentStaticIntensity`, `kCellMinIntensity`, `kCellHueRate`. New constants: `kCellIntensityBase`, `kCellIntensityJitter`, `kBarPulseMagnitude`, `kBarPulseShape`, `kPaletteStepSize`, `kBassTeamCutoff`, `kMidTeamCutoff`, `kTrebleTeamCutoff`. `kSeedMagnitude{A,B,C,D}` bumped 0.05 / 0.05 / 0.10 / 0.20 → 0.20 / 0.20 / 0.30 / 0.50.
- `Sources/Renderer/RayMarchPipeline.swift` placeholder buffer resized 360 → 376 B.
- `Tests/.../Presets/LumenPatternEngineTests.swift` updated: stride test 360 → 376; new Suite 9 (10 tests) covering rising-edge increment, falling-edge no-increment, 80 ms debounce in/out, energy-scaled `beatStrength`, `barPhase01` wrap detection, every-4-bass-beats fallback, mid + treble independent tracking, `reset()` zeroes counters, `setTrackSeed(_:)` zeroes counters.
- `PresetAcceptance` + `PresetRegression` + `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` + all other engine suites pass. Golden hashes for Lumen Mosaic + every other preset unchanged (the regression render path uses the placeholder zero-buffer; with all counters = 0 the LM.3.2 output collapses to the same dHash as LM.3).
- `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/lumen_mosaic/contact_sheets/LM.3.2/` ships 5 PNGs + README.md (fixtures: silence / mid / beat / hv_ha_mood / lv_la_mood). Uniform brightness across panel (LM.3.1 spotlit-blob failure mode gone). Beat fixture differs from mid fixture by ~30 % of cells advancing one palette step (bass-team rising-edge).
- CLAUDE.md updated: LumenMosaic.metal entry rewritten for D.5 dance model. New D-LM-d5 ledger row.

**Status:** ✅ **M7 pass 2026-05-10** (session `2026-05-10T15-44-27Z`). After eight calibration rounds (2026-05-09 / 2026-05-10), Matt confirmed: "Awesome. Finally. The movement of the color in the cells is looking good. I'd consider this a 'pass.'" Round-by-round narrative captured in `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/lumen_mosaic/contact_sheets/LM.3.2/README.md`: round 1 baseline → round 2 widened mood palette + cell density 30 → 15 → round 3 per-channel seed perturbation → round 4 HSV palette + emission gain 4 → 1 → round 5 frosted-glass surface character → round 6 beat envelope → round 7 frost in albedo → round 8 dropped beat envelope. Final architecture: HSV-driven palette + Voronoi-distance frost in albedo + cells hold previous palette state until next team beat + bar pulse on downbeat. Final commits: `76e21bf8` → `d4f66e21` (8 commits on `main`, NOT pushed). Carry-forward: track-to-track colour variation could be wider (Matt 2026-05-10 follow-up). Defer to LM.6 fidelity polish or earlier as a tuning pass — see Carry-forward below.

**Carry-forward.** LM.4 ships pattern bursts (radial ripples on drum onsets, sweeps on bar boundaries) that inject extra per-cell brightness — pattern colour comes from the same per-cell palette so a ripple takes the colour of the cells it crosses. The design doc covers per-stem hue affinity as an optional LM.5 sub-decision (deferred until LM.4 review tells us whether the LM.3.2 unified-palette feel needs stem differentiation). **Track-variation carry-forward (2026-05-10)**: Matt's M7 sign-off included "I'd like to see more color variation track to track, but this can be adjusted later." First lever: push `kSeedMagnitudeD` from 0.50 → 0.65 (controls per-track phase rotation in the per-channel hue-shift basis on `d`). Second lever: bump `kSeedMagnitudeA` from 0.20 → 0.30 (per-channel hue-shift on `a`). Third lever: increase `moodHueSpread` from 0.40 to 0.55 (widens cell-to-cell hue spread within a track, indirectly making track baselines more distinguishable). Schedule for LM.6 fidelity polish (since it's a tuning pass) or earlier as a follow-up if other Phase LM work warrants a touch-up release.

### Increment LM.4 — Pattern engine v1 (idle + radial_ripple + sweep)

**Scope.** Layer transient brightness spikes on top of the LM.3.2 cell field. Drum onsets fire `radialRipple` patterns from hash-derived origins in `[0.05, 0.95]²` UV; bar-counter rising edges fire either a `radialRipple` (from a separate hash family) or a `sweep` (from one of four panel-edge midpoints) — mood-weighted (high arousal biases 60/40 toward sweep, low arousal 60/40 toward ripple, mid-arousal 50/50). Pool capacity 4; overflowing spawns evict the oldest by max `phase`. **Patterns inject INTENSITY, not COLOUR (LM.3.2 architecture)** — each cell keeps its palette identity, the wavefront brightens whatever colour the cell already has, and the frost halo at cell boundaries (round 7) also brightens through `albedo = clamp(frosted_hue × cell_intensity, …)`. Reuses LM.3.2's existing 80 ms-debounced band-counter rising edges as the trigger source (no new bar-detection logic; the every-4-bass-beats `barCounter` fallback for reactive mode comes for free).

**Done when.**

- `Sources/Presets/Lumen/LumenPatterns.swift` ships `LumenPatternFactory` enum namespace with `idle()`, `radialRipple(origin:birthTime:duration:intensity:)`, `sweep(origin:direction:birthTime:duration:intensity:)`. Sweep direction normalised to unit length; zero-length input falls back to `(0, 1)`. Defaults: `radialRippleDuration = 0.6 s`, `sweepDuration = 0.8 s`, `defaultPeakIntensity = 1.0`. Colour fields stay zero (architecture invariant).
- `Sources/Presets/Lumen/LumenPatternEngine.swift` extended: new private state (`activePatterns: [LumenPattern]` capacity 4, `drumOnsetCounter: UInt32`, `barRotationCounter: UInt32`); `_tick` captures `prevBassCounter` + `prevBarCounter` before `updateBandCounters` and derives `bassFired` / `barFired` after; `updatePatterns(dt:bassFired:barFired:)` advances phases → culls retired → spawns ripple on bass rising edge → spawns mood-weighted bar pattern on bar rising edge → snapshots to `state.patterns`; `spawnPattern(_:)` evicts the oldest by max-phase when at capacity. Three separate hash families (`drumOnsetCounter ^ trackSeed` / `barRotationCounter ^ (trackSeed ^ 0xA5A5A5A5)` / `barRotationCounter ^ trackSeed`) avoid origin / kind collision. `lmHashU32(_:)` Swift helper is byte-identical to the shader's `lm_hash_u32`. `resetBeatTrackingState()` extended to zero the pattern pool + counters + the `state.patterns` snapshot.
- `Sources/Presets/Shaders/LumenMosaic.metal` ships three new evaluators: `lm_pattern_radial_ripple(cell_uv, p)` (Gaussian band centred on `radius = phase × kRippleMaxRadius (√2)`, σ narrows as ring grows); `lm_pattern_sweep(cell_uv, p)` (Gaussian band with `sweep_position = phase × 2 − 1` along `p.direction`, fixed σ); `lm_evaluate_active_patterns(cell_uv, lumen)` (sums per-pattern intensities dispatched on `kindRaw`, clamps to `kPatternMaxSum`). Integration site in `sceneMaterial` runs after `lm_cell_intensity` — `cell_intensity += lm_evaluate_active_patterns(...) × kPatternBoost (0.4)` so the boost propagates through `frosted_hue × cell_intensity` (halo brightens with patterns). Per-pattern helpers take `LumenPattern` by value (not `constant&`) to avoid the address-space mismatch in the loop body — Failed Approach #44 silent-drop avoided. New tuning constants: `kPatternBoost = 0.4`, `kPatternMaxSum = 1.0`, `kRippleMaxRadius = √2`, `kRippleSigmaBase = 0.10`, `kSweepSigma = 0.10`.
- `Tests/.../Presets/LumenPatternsTests.swift` ships 18 tests across 5 suites: factory contract (5), lifecycle (5 — spawn / phase advance / retire / reset clears / setTrackSeed clears), radial-ripple expansion math contract (3), sweep direction (3 — unit length / stable across phase / monotone phase), pool eviction (2).
- `PresetAcceptance` (D-037 invariants) + `PresetRegression` + `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` + `LumenPatternEngine` + `LumenPatterns` all green. PresetRegression Lumen Mosaic golden hash unchanged at `0xF0F0C8CCCCC8F0F0` (regression render path binds slot 8 to the zero placeholder → `activePatternCount = 0` → pattern contribution = 0).
- `CLAUDE.md` updated: LumenPatternEngine entry covers the new private state + reset semantics; LumenMosaic.metal entry covers the three new evaluators + integration site + tuning constants.
- p95 ≤ 3.0 ms at Tier 2 (pattern eval is per-fragment Gaussian + length over ≤ 4 slots — should be well under the existing LM.3.2 cost; tune `kPatternBoost` down if D-037 trips on the harness fixture).

**Verify.**

- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "LumenPatterns|LumenPatternEngine|PresetAcceptance|PresetRegression|PresetLoaderCompileFailure"`
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml` (touched files clean)
- Real-session capture for Matt review against the LM.3.2 contact-sheet checklist + the LM.4 acceptance items: (a) drum onsets visibly produce ripples expanding from coherent origins, deterministic per track on replay; (b) bar-rotation pattern character noticeably changes at bar boundaries on Spotify-prepared tracks; every-4-beats fallback feels coherent on reactive-mode tracks; (c) pattern + bar-pulse interaction reads as coherent emphasis (not fighting — if it does, halve `kPatternBoost`); (d) D-037 beat response ≤ 2× continuous + 1.0 invariant holds.

**Status:** ⏳ tests + docs landed 2026-05-10. Awaiting Matt review on a real-music session. Same discipline as LM.3.2 — tests passing + harness frames rendering ≠ done; the contact-sheet observation is the load-bearing acceptance gate.

**Carry-forward.** LM.4.1 follows up on first M7 review (ripple density + bleach-out). LM.4.5 follows on full-spectrum palette redesign. LM.5 adds the remaining pattern kinds: `clusterBurst`, `breathing`, `noiseDrift`. LM.6 was originally framed here as "specular sparkle on the Voronoi ridges via frost normal / Cook-Torrance pass" — that path was abandoned per the LM.3.2 round-7 / Failed Approach lock. The actual LM.6 increment (landed 2026-05-12, D-LM-6) is two albedo-only modulations in `sceneMaterial` (cell-depth gradient + optional centre hot-spot) with the SDF normal still flat; matID==1 lighting path still skips Cook-Torrance.

### Increment LM.4.1 — Ripple density + bleach-out fix

**Scope.** Three-line calibration change after first M7 review on session `2026-05-11T15-15-46Z`. (a) `radialRippleDuration` 0.6 → 0.3 s — at 118 BPM the kick fires every ~0.5 s; 0.6 s lifetime made every ripple overlap with the next by ~0.2 s and individual pulses never registered. (b) `kPatternBoost` 0.40 → 0.20 — combined peak `cell_intensity` (cell baseline × bar pulse + pattern boost) was hitting 1.70 against the `rgba8Unorm` 1.0 albedo clamp, slamming the bright channels of saturated HSV cells to white and destroying per-cell colour identity. (c) `kBarPulseMagnitude` 0.30 → 0.20 — LM.3.2 carry-forward; the bar pulse stacks on the pattern boost so cutting both was required to bring combined peak back to ~1.20.

**Done when.**

- `Sources/Presets/Lumen/LumenPatterns.swift` ships `radialRippleDuration = 0.3 s` with the LM.4.1 comment block explaining the tempo math.
- `Sources/Presets/Shaders/LumenMosaic.metal` ships `kPatternBoost = 0.20f` and `kBarPulseMagnitude = 0.20f` with LM.4.1 comment blocks explaining the bleach-out math.
- `Tests/.../Presets/LumenPatternsTests.swift` — `test_fivthSpawnEvictsOldest` and `test_pool_neverExceedsPatternCount` use `barPhase01` wraps (no debounce) instead of `beatBass` rising edges; at the new 0.3 s ripple lifetime, 80 ms-debounced bass spawns can't fill the pool before natural retirement, so the eviction code path was never exercised under the old test driver.
- All 18 LumenPatterns tests + PresetAcceptance + PresetRegression + PresetLoaderCompileFailure green. SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files.
- CLAUDE.md updated: LumenMosaic.metal tuning surface line reflects new values + LM.4.1 landed-work entry above the LM.4 entry, calling out the LM.4.5 carry-forward.

**Verify.**

- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "LumenPatterns|LumenPatternEngine|PresetAcceptance|PresetRegression|PresetLoaderCompileFailure"`
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml` (touched files clean; baseline preserved)
- Matt re-review on a real-music session: (a) individual ripples now read as discrete pulses, not a smear; (b) cells under ripples + bar pulse retain their colour identity (no near-white wash); (c) the LM.3.2 per-cell palette dance reads clearly through the patterns instead of being shouted over.

**Status:** ⏳ tests + docs landed 2026-05-11. Awaiting Matt re-review on a real-session capture.

**Carry-forward.** LM.4.1 only addresses ripple density + bleach-out. The deeper palette-scope limitation Matt called out in the same review — "literally any HEX code or Pantone shade" missing, including dark hues, regal purples, browns, grays — is the LM.4.5 scope (palette architecture redesign).

### Increment LM.4.3 — BeatGrid-driven triggers + ripples-as-accent

**Scope.** Replace the LM.3.2 FFT-band rising-edge triggers with `f.beatPhase01` / `f.barPhase01` grid wraps; demote ripples from per-kick to per-bar; preserve LM.3.2's team / period architecture but reinterpret bass/mid/treble as rate buckets (every beat / every 2 beats / every 4 beats) rather than FFT bands.

**Why.** Second M7 review (Matt 2026-05-11, session `2026-05-11T15-56-41Z`) made the LM.4 trigger failure conclusive. Diagnostic: all four tracks fired ripples at ~2.41/sec regardless of tempo. The trigger was `f.beatBass`, an FFT bass-band detector that fires on ~any sub-bass transient (kicks, bass-line notes, low harmonics) — completely decoupled from the song's actual beat. Same root cause affected the LM.3.2 cell-dance counters: cells stepped ~2.4× faster than the song's beat, hence "color does not really follow the music." Matt also reframed the deeper issue: per-kick ripples treat onset events as primary motion, inverting the CLAUDE.md Audio Data Hierarchy rule ("ACCENT ONLY — NEVER PRIMARY"). LM.4.3 fixes both — tempo-correct trigger source AND demote ripples to once-per-measure accent.

**Done when.**

- `Sources/Presets/Lumen/LumenPatternEngine.swift` — new private state (`prevBeatPhase01 / prevBarPhase01` wrap-edge detection + `gridBeatsSinceMidStep / gridBeatsSinceTrebleStep` subdivision counters); `updateBandCounters(features:)` rewritten to detect grid wraps (`prev > 0.85 && now < 0.15`) and advance counters uniformly +1.0 each on beat/bar wraps with mid every 2 / treble every 4; `updatePatterns(dt:barFired:)` simplified — no `bassFired` path; `advancePatternEngine` derives only `barFired`; `radialRippleOriginFromOnset()` and `drumOnsetCounter` deleted; `resetBeatTrackingState()` updated.
- `Sources/Presets/Lumen/LumenPatterns.swift` — `radialRippleDuration` restored 0.3 → 0.6 s (the LM.4.1 halving was necessary for the per-kick world; LM.4.3 per-bar spawning gives the longer lifetime plenty of headroom — ~1.4 s rest between accents on typical 4/4 at 120 BPM).
- `Tests/.../Presets/LumenPatternsTests.swift` — `fv()` helper `beatBass:` → `beatPhase01:`; new `spawnOnePatternViaBarWrap` helper; test_bassRisingEdge_spawnsRipple → test_barWrap_spawnsBarRotationPattern + new test_beatPhase01Wrap_doesNotSpawnPattern; lifecycle/expansion/sweep tests rewired through bar wraps.
- `Tests/.../Presets/LumenPatternEngineTests.swift` Suite 9 fully rewritten as LM.4.3 band-counter tests: `test_beatPhase01Wrap_incrementsBassCounterByOne`, `test_beatPhase01HeldHigh_doesNotIncrement`, `test_midAndTrebleTickAtSubdividedRates`, `test_barPhase01Wrap_incrementsBarCounter`, `test_noGridSignal_noBarCounterAdvance` (asserts the bar-fallback was retired), `test_fftBeatBass_aloneDoesNotAdvanceAnyCounter` (regression-locks the FFT-trigger retirement), `test_reset_zerosBandCounters`, `test_setTrackSeed_zerosBandCounters`.
- `PresetAcceptance` + `PresetRegression` + `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` + `LumenPatternEngine` + `LumenPatterns` all green. App build clean. SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files.
- `CLAUDE.md` updated: LumenPatternEngine entry rewritten for LM.4.3 semantics; LumenMosaic.metal tuning surface line reflects new defaults; LM.4.3 landed-work entry added above the LM.4.1 entry.

**Verify.**

- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "LumenPatterns|LumenPatternEngine|PresetAcceptance|PresetRegression|PresetLoaderCompileFailure"`
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` (full sweep; expect only the 3 documented pre-existing failures)
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build`
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml` (touched files clean; baseline preserved)
- Matt re-review on a real-music session: (a) ripples now fire once per musical bar (~0.5/sec on 4/4 at 120 BPM, ~0.07/sec on Pyramid Song's 16/8 at 70 BPM — both feel tempo-correct); (b) LM.3.2 color dance steps land on actual grid beats (cell color shifts visibly correlate to the song's pulse); (c) ripple-vs-pulse interaction is coherent emphasis, not fighting; (d) D-037 beat response invariant holds.

**Status:** ⏳ tests + docs landed 2026-05-11. Awaiting Matt re-review.

**Known limitation:** no FFT fallback — if `f.beatPhase01` never wraps (pure silence; pre-grid first ~10 s of live ad-hoc sessions), counters and patterns are static. Acceptable for prepared sessions (grid is at session start); LM.4.4 may add a fallback if reactive ad-hoc sessions surface the gap.

**Carry-forward.** LM.4.4 retired the pattern engine entirely after the third M7 review (the LM.4.3 trigger fix was confirmed but the ripple/sweep accent layer was rejected as "barely noticeable"). LM.4.5 (full-spectrum per-track palette redesign) is now the next planned increment.

### Increment LM.4.4 — Pattern engine retired

**Scope.** Delete the entire LM.4 pattern-spawn engine — Swift factory + engine pool state + spawn helpers + shader evaluator helpers + integration site. Keep the LM.3.2 cell-color dance (now driven by LM.4.3 grid-wrap counters) + the bar pulse as the entire visual story. GPU ABI (`LumenPatternState`, 376 B; `LumenPattern[4]` tuple; `LumenPatternKind` enum) preserved for future LM.5+ work that may rebind the slots to continuous fields (breathing / noiseDrift) rather than transient bursts.

**Why.** Third M7 review (Matt 2026-05-11, session `2026-05-11T17-02-17Z`): "The ripple sweep is not really doing much — it's barely noticeable. What value is it really adding?" Honest diagnosis: at execution-time-feasible boost levels the Gaussian wavefronts were invisible against the simultaneous bar pulse (both events fired on the downbeat; panel-wide pulse dominated the local +20% band by area). Pushing the wavefront brighter would have re-introduced the LM.4.1-resolved bleach-out. The CLAUDE.md Audio Data Hierarchy rule frames the structural redundancy: per-bar pattern events and the bar pulse were occupying the same downbeat moment, so they couldn't help but compete.

**Done when.**

- `Sources/Presets/Lumen/LumenPatterns.swift` deleted.
- `Tests/.../Presets/LumenPatternsTests.swift` deleted.
- `Sources/Presets/Lumen/LumenPatternEngine.swift` — pattern-pool state (`activePatterns`, `barRotationCounter`, `prevBarPhase01`) deleted; `updatePatterns`, `spawnPattern`, `spawnBarRotationPattern`, `writePatternsToState`, `radialRippleOriginFromBar`, `sweepEntryFromBar`, `chooseBarPatternKind`, `lmHashU32`, `trackSeedHash32` all deleted; `updateBandCounters` simplified to beat-wrap-only (no bar wrap); `advancePatternEngine` simplified to just call the band-counter update; `resetBeatTrackingState` updated; LM.4-era `swiftlint:disable type_body_length` removed (class shrank under the threshold).
- `Sources/Presets/Shaders/LumenMosaic.metal` — `lm_pattern_radial_ripple` / `lm_pattern_sweep` / `lm_evaluate_active_patterns` evaluator functions deleted; `kPatternBoost` / `kPatternMaxSum` / `kRippleMaxRadius` / `kRippleSigmaBase` / `kSweepSigma` constants deleted; `sceneMaterial` integration site (`cell_intensity += pattern_contribution * kPatternBoost`) deleted.
- `Tests/.../Presets/LumenPatternEngineTests.swift` Suite 9 — renamed `LumenLM43CounterTests` → `LumenLM44CounterTests`; `test_barPhase01Wrap_incrementsBarCounter` + `test_noGridSignal_noBarCounterAdvance` retired; replaced with `test_barCounter_neverAdvances_afterLM44` which regression-locks the dead-counter contract. `driveBarWrap` helper removed.
- `PresetAcceptance` + `PresetRegression` + `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` + `LumenPatternEngine` all green. App build clean. SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files; project baseline preserved.
- `CLAUDE.md` updated: `LumenPatterns.swift` module-map entry marked deleted; `LumenPatternEngine.swift` entry rewritten for LM.4.4 semantics; `LumenMosaic.metal` entry updated to reflect pattern engine retirement; tuning-surface line trimmed; LM.4.4 landed-work entry added above LM.4.3.

**Verify.**

- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "LumenPatternEngine|PresetAcceptance|PresetRegression|PresetLoaderCompileFailure"`
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` (full sweep; expect only the 3 documented pre-existing failures)
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build`
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml` (touched files clean)
- Matt re-review on a real-music session: panel shows LM.3.2 cell-color dance on every beat + bar pulse on downbeats only; no ripple/sweep wavefronts; cell colour identity preserved through the bar pulse (no bleach-out).

**Status:** ⏳ tests + docs landed 2026-05-11. Awaiting Matt re-review.

**Carry-forward.** LM.4.5 (full-spectrum per-track palette redesign) is the next planned increment. With the pattern engine gone, the palette redesign focuses cleanly on what actually matters: colour variety across the spectrum. LM.5 (clusterBurst / breathing / noiseDrift) becomes "continuous fields rebinding to the slot-8 buffer" if it ever lands — the GPU ABI is preserved exactly for that possibility, but it's no longer scheduled.

### Increment LM.4.5 — Full-spectrum palette redesign (per-track custom palette cards)

> **Renumbering note (2026-05-11).** This increment was originally numbered LM.4.2 when it was first scoped (during the LM.4.1 carry-forward planning). It stayed as a reserved name through LM.4.3 and LM.4.4 — both of those increments overtook it because urgent M7 feedback redirected the work to trigger-source fixes and pattern-engine retirement. The "LM.4.2" label was misleading because the number implied chronological precedence that never existed (LM.4.2 was never started). Renamed to LM.4.5 so the numbering reflects actual sequence: LM.4 → LM.4.1 → LM.4.3 → LM.4.4 → LM.4.5.

**Scope.** Replace the LM.3.2 mood-centred-narrow-jewel-tone palette with per-track custom palette cards drawn from the **full** HSV cube. Each track gets ~50 specific colours, picked procedurally from the entire colour space (full hue wheel, full saturation range, full brightness range). Cells pick one colour from the card. Mood biases the distribution (calm tracks tilt toward deeper/cooler regions; energetic tracks toward brighter/saturated) but does not restrict — every track can paint cells from anywhere in the cube. Result: cobalt next to oxblood next to charcoal with a violet edge next to amber next to bright crimson — the stained-glass-cathedral aesthetic, not the LM.3.2 jewel-tone-only register.

**Why.** Matt's first M7 review made the brief explicit: "I am asking you for VARIETY and the variety you are giving me is variety within a narrow scope. ... I want 90-95% more." The LM.3.2 palette structurally restricts to ~5% of the HSV cube (saturation floored at 0.78, brightness floored at 0.80, hue centred ±0.20 around mood). No tuning of those floors will deliver the 90-95% expansion he asked for; the palette model itself has to change.

**Guardrail.** The "no pastel" project rule (`CLAUDE.md` Visual Quality Floor) stays in force. Forbidden zone: saturation < 0.3 AND brightness > 0.6 — that's the cream-haze failure mode LM.2 fell into and we've forbidden since. The redesign achieves the full spectrum by **coupling** desaturation with darkness: low-saturation cells get pulled toward low brightness (charcoal, brown, slate), not high brightness (pastel). Everything else (full saturation × full brightness, mid-saturation × any brightness, high-saturation × low brightness for regal purples / deep ambers) is allowed.

**Done when.**

- `Sources/Presets/Shaders/LumenMosaic.metal` ships a new `lm_cell_palette_card(cellHash, lumen)` that procedurally generates an HSV triple from a hash seeded by (`trackPaletteSeed*`, `cellHash`). Hue spans the full wheel; saturation spans `[0.05, 1.0]`; brightness spans `[0.10, 0.95]`; pastel zone (sat < 0.3 AND val > 0.6) is collapsed by pulling val down. Mood biases the distribution (per-arousal brightness skew, per-valence hue-region skew) but does not restrict the envelope.
- Per-track distinctiveness: the same cell hash on two different tracks produces visibly different colours (full hash-space rotation per track, not just a narrow centre shift).
- Beat-step ratcheting (LM.3.2 team-counter dance) still works — `step = floor(team_counter / period)` advances each cell through its assigned palette path on team beats. Each step lands in a different region of the full cube, not in a neighbouring jewel tone.
- `PresetAcceptance` D-037 invariants pass with the wider palette (silence baseline, no white clip, beat response bounded, form complexity ≥ 2).
- New regression test: random-fixture sweep confirms the full HSV cube is sampled — the distribution of cell colours across 200 cells should span a wide hue range (≥ 270° of hue covered), wide saturation range (≥ 0.6 spread), and wide brightness range (≥ 0.5 spread). Cells satisfying the pastel forbidden zone count = 0.
- Contact sheet renders across 4 tracks (Love Rehab / So What / There There / Pyramid Song) show genuinely different palette cards — visibly different colour mixes, not rotated permutations of the same jewel tones.

**Verify.**

- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "LumenMosaic|PresetAcceptance|PresetRegression|LumenPatterns|LumenPatternEngine|PresetLoaderCompileFailure"`
- `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "PresetVisualReviewTests/renderPresetVisualReview"` (LM.4.5 contact sheet)
- Matt M7 review: every track's palette feels meaningfully distinct from every other track's, AND each track's palette spans the full spectrum (darks, regals, browns/slates, jewel tones, all visible in the same panel).

**Status:** ⚠ **LM.4.5 v1, LM.4.5.1, LM.4.5.2, LM.4.5.3 all SUPERSEDED by LM.4.6** (2026-05-12). The entire LM.4.5.x palette-iteration arc concluded with Matt's verdict on session `2026-05-12T00-29-30Z`: *"Working. It's close enough. I'm giving up the fight on colors."* The final shape is `Increment LM.4.6` below — pure uniform random RGB per cell, no rules. The spec above documents LM.4.5 v1's original intent (full HSV cube + pastel guardrail) which was rejected in production; the prompt's framing of "saturation full range [0, 1] + pastel guardrail" was the wrong abstraction. Each LM.4.5.x sub-increment attempted a different fix and was rejected in turn — see the iteration history in CLAUDE.md's LM.4.6 landed-work entry.

**Iteration history (all 2026-05-11)**:
- **LM.4.5 v1** (`a51a3b15`): full HSV cube + pastel guardrail `sat < 0.3 AND val > 0.6 → val ≤ 0.5`. Rejected: ~23 % cells in the mid-sat + high-val band still read as washed cream.
- **LM.4.5.1** (`54c908a7`): saturated stained-glass — `kSatFloor = 0.70` for jewel-tone-only. Rejected: "anchored to jewel tones, no muted earth tones."
- **LM.4.5.2** (`6c3e3661`): full sat range + coupling rule `val ≤ sat + 0.20`. Rejected: borderline pale cells at the margin.
- **LM.4.5.3** (`ce7b593b`): uncapped (no card) + per-cell brightness 0.30..1.60 + section salt + `kLumenEmissionGain` 1.5. Rejected: tracks still looked statistically identical at panel level; ~30 % dim/gray cells from wide brightness range; broken section salt never advanced (audio-energy accumulator, not seconds).
- **LM.4.6 anchor-distribution attempt** (uncommitted): 8 anchors weighted Pareto. Rejected: "no anchors, ANY color per cell."
- **LM.4.6 final** (`c0f9ccf3` + `888bb856` hotfix): pure uniform random RGB. Accepted.

**Why iteration didn't converge sooner**: Matt's ask had two simultaneous components — (a) each cell can be any colour independently, AND (b) different tracks look visibly different at the panel level. The strict reading was mathematically incompatible: uniform random sampling produces statistically similar panel aggregates regardless of seed (law of large numbers). Each LM.4.5.x sub-increment tried a different per-cell restriction; each was rejected. LM.4.6 shipped accepting (a) over (b) and documented the trade-off in the shader file header. **LM.7 subsequently revisited and partially resolved (b)** — Matt 2026-05-12 explicitly accepted relaxing (a) in spirit (most colours remain reachable on every track; the cube corner opposite the tint direction is forfeit at extreme seed values) in exchange for visible panel-aggregate distinction per track. See D-LM-7.

**Carry-forward.** `Increment LM.4.6` below replaces this spec as the LM.4.6 implementation. LM.5 (pattern engine v2) is retired per LM.4.4. **LM.6 (originally framed as "specular sparkle on cell relief" — Cook-Torrance via frost normal) was abandoned per the LM.3.2 round-7 / Failed Approach lock; what actually landed as LM.6 (2026-05-12, D-LM-6) is cell-depth gradient + optional hot-spot, both albedo-only modulations with the SDF normal still flat.** LM.7 (D-LM-7) followed same day with per-track aggregate-mean tint; Lumen Mosaic certified 2026-05-12 at LM.7. See LM.6 / LM.7 increment entries below.

### Increment LM.4.6 — Pure uniform random RGB per cell (final shape)

**Status:** ✅ landed 2026-05-12 (commits `c0f9ccf3` + hotfix `888bb856`). Matt sign-off: "*Working. It's close enough.*"

**Scope.** Replace LM.4.5.x's procedural HSV-with-rules palette with the simplest possible per-cell colour generator: three bytes of `lm_hash_u32(cellHash ^ stepMix ^ trackSeed ^ sectionMix)` mapped directly to RGB. No HSV indirection, no coupling rule, no mood gamma, no saturation floor, no anchor distribution, no spatial zones. Pure per-cell freedom.

**The contract.** Per Matt 2026-05-11: *"EVERY CELL CAN BE INDEPENDENT OF ITS NEIGHBORS... I literally want ANY possible color to be possible within ANY cell."* Each (cell, beat, track, section) tuple gets a unique 32-bit colour hash → RGB ∈ [0, 1]. Section salt = `lumen.bassCounter / 64` (every ~32 s on 120 BPM, resets on track change). Per-cell brightness multiplier tightened to `[0.85, 1.15]` (LM.4.5.3's wide `[0.30, 1.60]` produced dim/gray cells). `kLumenEmissionGain` reset to 1.0.

**Done when.**
- `lm_cell_palette` is a pure hash → RGB function with zero post-processing (no HSV, no coupling, no mood gamma).
- Section salt uses `bassCounter / 64` and actually advances (the LM.4.5.3 `accumulatedAudioTime` proxy was an audio-energy accumulator, never reached bucket 1 in real playback).
- `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` rewritten for LM.4.6 (7 tests / 5 suites): per-cell uniqueness, RGB channel coverage, per-track distinctness, determinism, beat-step change, section boundary mutation, within-section stability.
- `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` passes (15 production presets — LM.4.6 hex-literal hotfix `888bb856` was caught by this test).
- App + engine build clean; SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files.
- Matt M7 review: "close enough" verdict reached.

**Verify.**
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "LumenPalette|PresetLoaderCompileFailure|PresetRegression|PresetAcceptance"`
- `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetVisualReview` (Lumen Mosaic 9-fixture contact sheet)
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build`

**Honest math caveat (documented in shader file header).** Uniform random sampling produces statistically similar panel-aggregates across tracks (different specific colours per cell, same distribution shape — law of large numbers). LM.4.6 prioritises per-cell freedom over panel-level distinction; track-to-track distinction at the panel level was explored extensively across LM.4.5.x and consistently rejected at the time. **Superseded by LM.7** (per-track aggregate-mean tint, 2026-05-12) — Matt re-opened the trade-off after seeing the LM.6 contact sheet and explicitly accepted the relaxation of strict "any colour reachable in every track" for visible track-to-track variety. See LM.7 below.

**Carry-forward.** LM.6 (cell-depth gradient + optional hot-spot) is the planned next increment. Implemented and landed 2026-05-12.

### Increment LM.6 — Cell-depth gradient + optional hot-spot

**Status:** ✅ landed 2026-05-12. Matt M7 sign-off via real-music session `2026-05-12T17-15-14Z`.

**Scope.** Add physical-glass dome character to each cell without touching the palette or geometry. Two modulations on `cell_hue` between palette lookup and frost diffusion in `sceneMaterial`: (1) depth gradient — `cell_hue *= mix(kCellEdgeDarkness, 1.0, 1 - smoothstep(0, cellV.f2 × kDepthGradientFalloff, cellV.f1))` — full brightness at cell centre (f1 → 0), `kCellEdgeDarkness (0.55)` at boundary (f1 → f2); (2) optional hot-spot — `cell_hue += pow(1 - smoothstep(0, kHotSpotRadius × cellV.f2, cellV.f1), kHotSpotShape) × kHotSpotIntensity × cell_hue` — additive on the cell's own hue (not toward white), 30 % brightness boost in inner 15 % of each cell with `pow^4` sharp falloff. Driven entirely by the Voronoi field already computed for cell ID + frost; zero extra cost. SDF relief stays flat (`kReliefAmplitude = 0`, `kFrostAmplitude = 0`) per LM.3.2 round-7 / Failed Approach lock — no normal-driven path, no per-pixel dot artifacts. The matID==1 emission lighting contract is unchanged.

**Done when.**
- 5 new file-scope `constant float` knobs (`kCellEdgeDarkness = 0.55f`, `kDepthGradientFalloff = 1.0f`, `kHotSpotRadius = 0.15f`, `kHotSpotShape = 4.0f`, `kHotSpotIntensity = 0.30f`).
- 3 new tests in `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` Suite 6 (centre-brighter-than-edge / hot-spot peaks-at-centre / depth-gradient-monotonic-across-radius) mirror the shader math in Swift.
- `PresetRegression` Lumen Mosaic golden hash unchanged at `0xF0F0C8CCCCC8F0F0` — modulation is per-pixel Voronoi-driven, dHash 9×8 luma quantization at 64×64 is dominated by cell boundary positions not per-cell intensity gradients.
- Engine + app build clean. `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` passes (15 presets — shader didn't silent-drop).
- SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files.

**Verify.**
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "LumenPalette|PresetRegression|PresetAcceptance|PresetLoaderCompileFailure"`
- `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetVisualReview`

**Carry-forward.** Matt re-opened the LM.4.6 "panel-aggregate uniform across tracks" complaint after the LM.6 contact-sheet review — see LM.7 below.

### Increment LM.7 — Per-track aggregate-mean RGB tint + chromatic projection

**Status:** ✅ landed 2026-05-12. Matt M7 sign-off via real-music session `2026-05-12T17-15-14Z`. **Lumen Mosaic certified.**

**Scope.** Add a small per-track RGB tint vector to every cell's uniform random RGB before the saturate-clamp, derived from existing `lumen.trackPaletteSeed{A,B,C}` (∈ [−1, +1] from FNV-1a hash of `title|artist`) and scaled by `kTintMagnitude = 0.25f`. Per-cell freedom preserved: cells still independently sample the full uniform RGB cube; only the *window* slides per track. Closes the LM.4.6 "panel-aggregate is statistically identical across tracks" complaint Matt explicitly voiced on the LM.6 contact sheet: *"mean should NOT be middle-gray; the mean should be different for each track played."*

**Chromatic projection (same-day follow-up).** First visual review showed `track_v1` (seed (+1,+1,+1,+1) → naive tint (+0.25, +0.25, +0.25)) washed toward white; `track_v2` (seed all-negative) would have correspondingly washed toward black. Root cause: a tint vector with non-zero mean component shifts the achromatic axis (brightness), not the chromatic plane (hue). Fix: subtract the mean component before scaling — `meanShift = (rawTint.r + g + b) / 3; trackTint = (rawTint - meanShift) × kTintMagnitude`. Projects every tint onto the chromatic plane perpendicular to (1,1,1). Achromatic-aligned seeds collapse to neutral (LM.4.6 baseline behaviour) rather than washing.

**Done when.**
- `kTintMagnitude = 0.25f` file-scope constant.
- 6 LOC in `lm_cell_palette` adding chromatic-projected tint vector application before `saturate(...)`.
- Swift mirror in `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` with `LMPalette.tintMagnitude` constant + tint application in `lmCellPaletteRGB`.
- New Suite 7 `LM.7 — per-track aggregate-mean tint` with 5 tests: warm-track-leans-warm, cool-track-leans-cool, distinct-tracks-have-distinct-aggregate-means (pairwise RGB-distance ≥ 0.20), neutral-track-near-middle-gray, achromatic-aligned-seed-does-not-wash (regression-locks the chromatic-projection fix).
- `PresetRegression` Lumen Mosaic golden hash UNCHANGED at `0xF0F0C8CCCCC8F0F0` (regression harness leaves slot-8 zero-bound → trackPaletteSeed = 0 → tint = 0 → identical to LM.4.6 path). All other preset hashes byte-identical.
- Engine + app build clean. SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files.
- Matt M7 sign-off + cert flip.

**Verify.**
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "LumenPalette|PresetRegression|PresetAcceptance|PresetLoaderCompileFailure|FidelityRubric"`
- `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetVisualReview` — `track_v1`/`v2` panels collapse to neutral (no wash); `track_v3`/`v4` panels display distinct magenta and green chromatic tints. File-size delta on the PNGs confirms the fix lands without disturbing non-aligned tracks.

**Honest trade-off documented.** The LM.4.6 "any colour reachable on every track" framing is preserved *in spirit* but no longer *strictly*. Most colours remain reachable on every track; the most-extreme cube corners are forfeit at the seedA/B/C = ±1 limit (where their channel clamps would have been required to land at the corner). Side-effect of the chromatic projection: tracks whose `trackPaletteSeed{A,B,C}` happen to align with the achromatic diagonal collapse to LM.4.6-neutral. FNV-1a hash of `title|artist` distributes seeds roughly uniformly in [−1, +1]³, so achromatic-aligned tracks occur in a small minority of cases. Matt 2026-05-12 explicitly accepted both trade-offs.

**Phase LM CLOSED.** Lumen Mosaic certified 2026-05-12. `certified: true` in `LumenMosaic.json`; `"Lumen Mosaic"` added to `FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets` ground truth. Next preset eligible for fidelity uplift if Matt prioritises (see CLAUDE.md Phase G-uplift). The preset's automated rubric gate (`meetsAutomatedGate`) still reads false because M3 mat_* heuristic fails (Lumen Mosaic uses voronoi_f1f2 + matID==1 emission path rather than the V.3 material cookbook); visual fidelity bar is met by other means per SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.1 M7 ("Matt-approved reference frame match" is the load-bearing gate).

**BUG-004 closed 2026-05-12** as a downstream consequence. The BUG-004 closure increment expanded `GoldenSessionTests.makeRealCatalog()` from 11 → 15 production presets so the orchestrator's `includeUncertifiedPresets: false` filter is now end-to-end exercised against the real production cert state; added a new `Session D` test (`sessionD_lumenMosaicWinsFirstSegment`) that regression-locks Lumen Mosaic winning at least one segment under a plausible mood profile (BPM=75 / val=0.0 / arous=+0.30); and fixed the stale `MatIDDispatchTests.kLumenEmissionGain` constant (4.0 → 1.0 post-LM.3.2-round-4). Milestone D advances **0 → 1 / 22+** with Lumen Mosaic as Phosphene's first production certified preset. See `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` Resolved section for the full closure entry.

### Increment LM.4.7 — Curated 18-palette library + mood-biased Orchestrator selection

**Status:** ✅ Implementation landed 2026-05-18; Matt M7 sign-off on the same-day 5-track session with one tuning note (within-quadrant clustering), addressed by the same-day amendment widening `kAntiRepeatWindow` from N=1 to N=3 (`[dev-2026-05-18-b]`, D-LM-palette-library amended). Paperwork-only session earlier the same day filed `D-LM-palette-library` + `D-LM-cream-rescission`; CLAUDE.md + KNOWN_ISSUES.md + this entry updated.

**Scope.** Replace LM.4.6's `lm_cell_palette` uniform-random-RGB body (and the LM.7 per-track chromatic-projected tint built on top of it) with palette-library-driven cell colours. **Each song** selects one of **18 hand-authored 12-colour palettes**; the Orchestrator picks the palette via a mood-biased Gaussian-over-distance weight function with the immediately previous song's palette excluded from the candidate set. Within a song, cells sample uniformly from the drawn palette's 12 entries via cell-hash modulo 12. The per-track seed perturbs **sampling order** within the palette (which 12-bucket a given cell lands in for that track) — never palette membership. The LM.3.2 team/period beat-step ratchet is preserved; cells advance their palette index on rising-edge of their assigned band's beat. Cites `D-LM-palette-library`.

The pale-tone-share gate (≤ 0.30 of cells; pale = linear RGB `min(R, G, B) > 0.65`) lands in this increment as the mechanical enforcement of `D-LM-cream-rescission`. Cathedral Lights is the calibration palette (~25 % nominal pale-cell share, ~30 % worst-case under hash-draw variance).

**The 18 palettes.** Vol. I — Autumnal, Refn Glow, Glacier, Art Deco, Abyssal Bioluminescence, Kintsugi, Carnival. Vol. II — Holi, Geode, Rothko Chapel, Tropical Aviary, Persian Miniature, Ukiyo-e. Plate 14 — Cathedral Lights. Plates 15–18 — Cycladic, Ming Porcelain, Tenebrism, Obsidian.

**Done when.**

- New file `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/LumenMosaicPaletteLibrary.swift` defines 18 palettes as Swift structs carrying a `name: String`, a 12-entry `colors: [SIMD3<Float>]` (linear RGB), and an explicit `moodAnchor: SIMD2<Float>` in normalised mood-space coordinates `[-1, +1]` per axis (valence on x, arousal on y). Palettes named to match the design artifacts (Autumnal, Refn Glow, Glacier, Art Deco, Abyssal Bioluminescence, Kintsugi, Carnival, Holi, Geode, Rothko Chapel, Tropical Aviary, Persian Miniature, Ukiyo-e, Cathedral Lights, Cycladic, Ming Porcelain, Tenebrism, Obsidian). Hex values per `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/lumen_mosaic/palette_library/`.
- Orchestrator selection model implemented: per-song weighted draw via Gaussian-over-distance from each palette's `moodAnchor` to the current track's `(valence, arousal)`, with the immediately previous song's palette removed from the candidate set. Draw seeded by track identity so it's reproducible. Per `D-LM-palette-library`: mood biases **selection probability**, never deterministic mapping; every eligible palette has non-zero probability everywhere in the mood plane.
- `lm_cell_palette` (MSL) rewritten to index into the per-session palette via `palette_idx = lm_hash_u32(cell_id ^ step ^ track_seed ^ section_salt) % 12` and look up the corresponding palette entry. The pre-LM.4.7 hash → RGB-cube path is removed. The LM.7 per-track chromatic-projected tint path is removed (`kTintMagnitude` retires).
- Slot-8 GPU ABI extended to carry the 12-colour palette as 36 floats (or equivalent per implementation choice — e.g. 12 × `float4` packed). `LumenPatternState` stride updated; Swift-side `CommonLayoutTest` regression-locks the new size. `directPresetFragmentBuffer3` setter wires the per-session palette into the binding.
- `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` rewritten — assertions on **palette membership** (every cell colour matches one of the 12 palette entries to within float epsilon), per-session palette stability, mood-biased selection probability distribution shape, palette character distinctness across the 18-palette set. Replaces the existing Suite 7 (LM.7 chromatic-projection assertions); LM.7-specific tests retire with the LM.7 code path.
- LM.9 pale-tone-share gate implemented as a new test (location TBD — `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` or `FidelityRubric`): per non-silence fixture frame, classify each cell by linear RGB; reject the fixture if `pale_cell_count / total_cells > 0.30`. **Passes for all 18 palettes mechanically.** Cathedral Lights specifically must pass at its ~25 % nominal share with margin.
- `PresetRegression` Lumen Mosaic golden hash regenerated — the regression harness's slot-8 zero-bound default is no longer equivalent to "neutral palette" because the cell-colour lookup is into a palette table. The new golden hash reflects the post-LM.4.7 baseline; the regression test pins the new value.
- Engine + app build clean; SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files.
- **Matt M7 review** on a real-music multi-track session: each song's drawn palette reads as its named character (Cathedral Lights → stained-glass, Refn Glow → warm-neon-shadow, Glacier → frozen-blue-on-snow, etc.); the per-song palette change is visible at track boundaries (panel character shifts when the track shifts) and the mood-biased selection feels appropriate per track (low-valence / high-arousal tracks trend toward Rothko Chapel / Tenebrism / Abyssal Bioluminescence; high-valence / high-arousal tracks trend toward Carnival / Holi / Tropical Aviary; etc.) without being deterministic; the anti-repeat rule is visible on a contrived playlist (e.g. forcing two consecutive low-valence-low-arousal tracks should pick different palettes, not Cathedral Lights twice in a row).

**Verify.**

- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "LumenPalette|PresetLoaderCompileFailure|PresetRegression|PresetAcceptance|FidelityRubric"`
- `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetVisualReview` — 18-palette contact sheet at the standard 9-fixture set, plus per-palette mean / aggregate-character verification.
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build`
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml`

**Honest trade-offs documented.** Per-cell freedom is narrower than LM.4.6: each cell samples one of 12 colours, not from the full 16M-colour RGB cube. Matt explicitly accepted this trade-off in the 2026-05-17 conversation in exchange for palette character per session. Across the 18 palettes, the union of reachable colours covers a wide swath of the cube; what changes is that **within a given session**, only 12 colours appear, which is the property that makes the palette read as a coherent visual identity.

**Carry-forward.** Resolves BUG-014 (`docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` Open) — flip to Resolved with the LM.4.7 commit hash. New palette additions (post-LM.4.7) require Matt M7 review per palette and a `D-LM-palette-library`-citing amendment in `DECISIONS.md`. Palette removals are also gated on Matt sign-off. The LM.7 chromatic-projection code path retires with LM.4.7; the `kTintMagnitude` constant and the `test_achromaticAlignedSeed_doesNotWash` test are removed (the failure mode they regression-lock cannot occur on the palette-table path because cells sample from a curated 12-entry table that, by construction, avoids the achromatic-axis wash).

## Phase CA — Capability Audit (2026-05-20)

**Motivation.** Drift between docs and code is real and has cost session time. Concrete evidence from the 2026-05-20 design conversation: a Cold-Start design pass proposed building "C2 + first-onset anchoring" infrastructure that turned out to **already exist in production** via the BUG-007.x series — Claude had no prior knowledge of it because it wasn't surfaced in the high-traffic docs. Same session: `docs/CAPABILITY_GAP_AUDIT.md` is referenced from this file but doesn't exist as a file. These are not hypothetical drift; they are blocking real work.

Phase CA addresses the drift systematically through per-subsystem code-vs-docs audits. Each increment audits one subsystem: reads the actual source, traces consumers, cross-references docs, and assigns a health verdict to every capability the subsystem exposes. Output is `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/<subsystem>.md` per pass, plus a top-level `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md` index assembled after multiple passes.

**Phase scope is one-increment-at-a-time.** The wider phase plan firms up after CA.1's "approach validation" step confirms the format produces actionable value. Do not plan CA.2-CA.N upfront.

### Increment CA.1 — DSP / MIR

**Status.** ✅ Landed 2026-05-20. Kickoff doc: [`docs/prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA1_DSP_MIR_2026-05-20.md`](prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA1_DSP_MIR_2026-05-20.md). Audit deliverable: [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/DSP_MIR.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/DSP_MIR.md). Summary: 18 of 22 file-level entities `production-active`; 1 runtime `production-orphan` cluster (per-frame `StructuralAnalyzer` chain has no live consumer; output is read only at preparation time); 1 field-level `production-orphan` (`MIRPipeline.spectralRolloff` public exposure); 1 `built-but-undocumented` (`MIRPipeline+Recording` parallel CSV path); 2 `boundary-deferred` (`GridOnsetCalibrator` + `BeatGridAnalyzer` live in `Session/` but function as DSP capabilities); 0 `broken-but-claimed`. Doc-drift corrections applied to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (module map drift — 6 files missing; MIR-component list missing `LiveBeatDriftTracker` + `StructuralAnalyzer`; Chroma 65 Hz → 500 Hz value drift; Session-Recording manual `R`-path note) + `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` (Capability-Gap-Audit pointer corrected to Phase CA). One retroactive `Resolved` entry filed: [BUG-R010 PT.1 ring-buffer fix](QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md). The audit's approach-validation section recommends ML as the CA.2 subsystem (DSP↔ML boundary closes cleanly; Beat This! infrastructure already partly tested under `Tests/ML/`).

**Scope.** All 20 files in `PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/` plus DSP-adjacent capabilities at subsystem boundaries (DSP↔Audio, DSP↔ML, DSP↔Session, DSP↔App). The DSP subsystem is first because (a) it's the subsystem where this session's blind spot lived (BUG-007.x cold-start beat-sync infrastructure invisible to Claude); (b) the BUG-007.x series produced significant incremental infrastructure most likely to be undercaptured in docs; (c) the output feeds directly into Phase CS verification work.

**Output.** `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/DSP_MIR.md`. Plus BUG entries for any `broken-but-claimed` findings; doc-drift corrections to load-bearing docs in the same increment.

**Verdicts assigned per capability.** `production-active`, `production-orphan`, `dead`, `stub`, `documented-but-missing`, `built-but-undocumented`, `broken-but-claimed`, `unverified-claim`, `boundary-deferred`. Definitions in the kickoff doc.

**Discipline.** Audit-only. No code changes during the audit beyond the new audit doc and minor doc-drift corrections. Fix work that the audit surfaces is scheduled as separate increments. Stop-and-report criteria and methodology fully spec'd in the kickoff document — read it before starting.

**Done-when.** Audit document published with verdicts for every public capability in scope; all `broken-but-claimed` findings have BUG entries; drift corrections to CLAUDE.md / ENGINEERING_PLAN.md / DECISIONS.md landed; approach-validation section produces an honest critique of whether the format should continue.

**After CA.1 lands** — surface to Matt: summary counts, recommended approach changes for CA.2, recommended next subsystem (audit-driven, may not be the originally-planned "Audio").

### Increment CA.2 — ML

**Status.** ✅ Landed 2026-05-20. Kickoff doc: [`docs/prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA2_ML_2026-05-20.md`](prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA2_ML_2026-05-20.md). Audit deliverable: [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ML.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ML.md). Summary: 14 of 16 files `production-active`; 4 cluster-level `production-orphan` findings at the field/method level (cited grep each per CA.2 §production-orphan rule — `StemFFTEngineProtocol`, `StemSeparator.stft/.istft` wrappers, 5 `BeatThisModel` model-dimension constants, 2 `MoodClassifier` static lets plus 3 error-type public exposures); 2 large `built-but-undocumented` gaps (Beat This! transformer entirely absent from `ARCHITECTURE.md §ML Inference`; `ML/` module-map missing 9 of 16 files); 1 `documented-but-missing` (`ARCHITECTURE.md §Mood Classifier Inputs` claimed AGC-normalized flux; code passes raw smoothed flux — training and runtime agreed, only the doc was wrong). 0 `broken-but-claimed`; 0 new BUG entries. Doc-drift corrections applied to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§ML Inference Beat This! narrative + window-size constants; §Module Map ML/ block with 9 added files; §Mood Classifier Inputs per-index table) and `KNOWN_ISSUES.md §BUG-012 → Instrumentation installed` (pointer to the audit's BUG-012 instrumentation map — the centralised reading-aid that previously didn't exist anywhere). **The audit did not edit any of the 8 BUG-012-i1-instrumented files** per CA.2 Hard Rules. The audit's read of every BUG-012-adjacent code path produced no new candidate root cause; one small diagnostic enrichment is suggested for the next instrumentation tranche as `CA.2-FU-2` (blocked on BUG-012 closure). **Approach validation:** continue into CA.3 with one tweak — Explore agents over-asserted `public` on internal types in 3 of 4 CA.2 cases; a single visibility grep across the agent's claimed-public types catches it. Recommended next subsystem: **Session** (CA.1 + CA.2 between them flagged three boundary-deferred Session placements — `GridOnsetCalibrator`, `BeatGridAnalyzer`, and the `MoodClassifier.currentState` read-at-end-of-prep pattern). Alternative: defer CA.3 scope decision until BUG-012 step-2 diagnosis lands if it reproduces.

**Scope.** All 16 files in `PhospheneEngine/Sources/ML/` (4,507 LoC) — Beat This! transformer × 5, StemSeparator + StemModel + StemFFT × 9, MoodClassifier × 2, ML.swift × 1 — plus boundary annotations to DSP (BeatThisPreprocessor / BeatGridResolver / StemAnalyzer), Session (BeatGridAnalyzer; deferred from CA.1), Renderer (MLDispatchScheduler), and App (VisualizerEngine+Stems / +Audio). Excluded by scope: `Sources/ML/Weights/` (data files); `BeatGridAnalyzer` and `GridOnsetCalibrator` (Session module — CA.1 boundary-deferred and re-confirmed by CA.2); `MLDispatchScheduler` (Renderer module); `VisualizerEngine+*` (App module).

**Output.** `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ML.md`. Plus drift corrections in the same increment. No new BUG entries (BUG-012 already covers the open defect in this subsystem).

**Discipline.** Audit-only. No code changes during the audit beyond the new audit doc and the listed doc-drift corrections. **The 8 BUG-012-i1-instrumented files** (`StemFFT.swift`, `StemFFT+CPU.swift`, `StemFFT+GPU.swift`, `StemSeparator.swift`, `Shared/BUG012Probe.swift`, `VisualizerEngine.swift`, `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift`, `Tests/.../BUG012ConcurrencyTest.swift`) were off-limits to edits per CA.2 Hard Rules — the audit read them freely but modified none of them; findings that would have required editing one of them are registered in the audit's Follow-up Backlog (FU-1, FU-2, FU-3 are all BUG-012-blocked).

**Done-when.** Audit document published; every public capability has a verdict; every `production-orphan` cites its grep; every non-`production-active` finding either ships a doc-fix in this increment or is registered as a `CA.2-FU-N` follow-up; no edits to BUG-012-i1 instrumented files.

**After CA.2 lands** — surface to Matt: summary counts, recommended approach changes for CA.3, recommended next subsystem (Session unless BUG-012 reproduces in the meantime), any BUG-012-adjacent findings the next reproduction's diagnosis should weigh (none surfaced — race-surface analysis remains the most current understanding).

### Increment CA.3 — Session

**Status.** ✅ Landed 2026-05-20. Kickoff doc: [`docs/prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA3_SESSION_2026-05-20.md`](prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA3_SESSION_2026-05-20.md). Audit deliverable: [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/SESSION.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/SESSION.md). Summary: 21 of 22 file-level entities `production-active`; 1 `stub` (`LocalFolderConnector.swift` — `#if ENABLE_LOCAL_FOLDER_CONNECTOR`-gated v2 scaffold; flag never set in any xcconfig or Package.swift; class never compiles in production builds — intentional per D-046 / UX_SPEC §4.4); 2 `documented-but-missing` findings in `ARCHITECTURE.md` (a — `§Session Preparation` step list at lines 112–124 omitted D-070 preview-URL primary path, Beat This! offline grid, DSP.4 drums-stem grid, BUG-007.8 grid-onset calibration, and Round 26 metadata-driven meter override; b — `§Module Map Tests/Session/` referenced a nonexistent `StemCacheTests`); 2 large `built-but-undocumented` gaps (Session/ module-map block listed 9 of 22 files — 13 missing; Tests/Session/ block listed 9 of 14 real files — 6 missing + 1 phantom); 0 `production-orphan`; 0 `broken-but-claimed`; 0 new BUG entries. **The audit also flagged a kickoff-prompt staleness**: BUG-006 was cited as Open/P1 by the prompt but `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` already shows `Status: Resolved` (BUG-006.2 wiring fix, 2026-05-06, validated end-to-end by session capture `2026-05-06T20-11-46Z`). Confirming the kickoff against the issue file before starting is now a recommended CA.4 methodology step. Doc-drift corrections applied to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§Session Preparation rewritten as a 7-step pipeline reflecting current code; §Module Map Session/ block extended with 13 missing files and one-line descriptions including a v2-scaffold note for LocalFolderConnector; §Module Map Tests/Session/ block corrected — phantom StemCacheTests removed, 6 real test files added; §Session Recording (Diagnostics) gained a one-paragraph WIRING:-log surface note). **The CA.1/CA.2 boundary-deferred items all resolved here**: `GridOnsetCalibrator` → `production-active`, recommend relocating to `Sources/DSP/` per `CA.3-FU-1` (functionally a DSP capability; both consumers already import DSP — closes CA.1-FU-5's GridOnsetCalibrator half); `BeatGridAnalyzer` → `production-active`, **stays in Session/** (testability-seam pattern co-located with consumer is correct); `MoodClassifier.currentState` end-of-prep read → `production-active`, intentional EMA-smoothed-state architecture (not drift). **Approach validation:** continue into CA.4 with the methodology refinements above — direct file reads scale to ≤ 5k-LoC subsystems; agents remain right for larger modules but the visibility-verification grep is mandatory regardless; cross-check kickoff prompts against `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` as a routine step. Recommended next subsystem: **Orchestrator** (Session ↔ Orchestrator surface touchpoints already surfaced — TrackProfile, SessionPlan → PlannedSession lift, PlannedSession.canonicalIdentity consumed during prepared-cache wiring; auditing Orchestrator closes that boundary cleanly before CA-App).

**Scope.** All 22 files in `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/` (~3,425 LoC across 20 top-level files + 2 `Connectors/`) — lifecycle + state machine × 6, preparation pipeline × 6, track / playlist value types × 3, boundary-resolved-from-CA.1 × 2, quality gates × 1, connectors × 2, module marker × 1, stub × 1. Boundary annotations: Session ↔ App (SessionManager observable surface + SpotifyOAuthTokenProvider concrete in App layer per D-069 Decision 2), Session ↔ Orchestrator (TrackProfile / SessionPlan consumption boundaries), Session ↔ DSP (BeatGrid / BeatDetector / MIRPipeline usage), Session ↔ ML (StemSeparator / MoodClassifier / BeatThisModel composition), Session ↔ Audio (MetadataPreFetcher pre-fetch path). Excluded by scope: `PhospheneApp/` (CA-App later); `Sources/Orchestrator/` (CA-Orchestrator next); `Sources/Renderer/` MLDispatchScheduler (CA-Renderer); `Sources/Audio/` internals (CA-Audio later).

**Output.** `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/SESSION.md`. Plus drift corrections in the same increment. No new BUG entries.

**Discipline.** Audit-only. No code changes during the audit beyond the new audit doc and the listed doc-drift corrections. The 8 BUG-012-i1-instrumented files remained off-limits to edits per the Hard Rules carried forward from CA.2 — Session-side touchpoint is `SessionPreparer+Analysis.swift:76 separator.separate(...)`, which routes through the BUG-012-instrumented dispatch chain but was not modified.

**Done-when.** Audit document published; every public capability has a verdict; every Explore-agent-claimed public symbol cross-checked against visibility grep (CA.3 used direct reads, so cross-check ran as a final pass — all internal types correctly scoped); every non-`production-active` finding either ships a doc-fix in this increment or is registered as a `CA.3-FU-N` follow-up; all three CA.1/CA.2 boundary-deferred items have final verdicts; drift corrections to load-bearing docs landed; no edits to BUG-012-i1 instrumented files; "Approach validation" section produces an honest critique of whether the format should continue into CA.4.

**After CA.3 lands** — surface to Matt: summary counts, recommended approach changes for CA.4, recommended next subsystem (Orchestrator), the verdict on the three CA.1/CA.2 boundary-deferred items + the GridOnsetCalibrator-relocation recommendation (`CA.3-FU-1`), and the LocalFolderConnector keep-vs-delete product call (`CA.3-FU-2`). No BUG-006-adjacent diagnosis surfaced (BUG-006 already Resolved).

### Increment CA.4 — Orchestrator

**Status.** ✅ Landed 2026-05-20. Kickoff doc: [`docs/prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA4_ORCHESTRATOR_2026-05-20.md`](prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA4_ORCHESTRATOR_2026-05-20.md) (commit `9fc1a6c9`). Audit deliverable: [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ORCHESTRATOR.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ORCHESTRATOR.md). Summary: 12 of 14 file-level entities `production-active` at the Orchestrator-module surface; **1 `broken-but-claimed` cluster filed as [BUG-015](QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md#bug-015) (P1)** — `VisualizerEngine.applyLiveUpdate(...)` has zero production call sites; the entire Phase 4.5 / 4.6 runtime adaptation pipeline is dead in production despite ENGINEERING_PLAN.md marking both increments ✅. **1 `production-orphan`** (`DefaultLiveAdapter.transitionPolicy` field — declared, stored, never invoked). **1 `unverified-claim`** (PresetScorer.swift:86 doc comment cites D-030 instead of D-032 for the Weight rationale). **2 large `built-but-undocumented`** (ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map Orchestrator/ block listed 5 of 14 files; §Module Map Tests/Orchestrator/ block was absent entirely). **Plus 4 doc-drift findings** — ARCHITECTURE.md §Orchestrator "Forthcoming (4.4+)" list obsolete; line-211 cutEnergyThreshold > 0.7 stale (code: 0.85); DECISIONS.md D-032 lacks the D-080 amendment trail; `PresetSignaling.swift:9-10` source-doc claims "Arachne does NOT emit yet — wiring is V.7.8" but emission shipped V.7.7C.2 / D-095 2026-05-09 + orchestrator-side wiring shipped BUG-011 round 8 2026-05-12. **D-120 revert verified clean** — cited grep returns zero residue. **CA.1 synthetic-StructuralPrediction re-evaluation resolved**: synthetic at `SessionPlanner.swift:317` is planning-time only; runtime predictions go through `DefaultLiveAdapter.adapt(liveBoundary:)` which is unreachable until BUG-015 lands. CA.1-FU-1 re-scoped to ship option (a) — gate the per-frame `StructuralAnalyzer` chain to prep-time only — independently of BUG-015 (saves audio-callback CPU with zero behavioural change since no runtime consumer exists today). Doc-drift corrections applied to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§Orchestrator rewrite + Module Map extension + Tests/Orchestrator/ block addition), `DECISIONS.md` (D-032 amendment note), and in-source comments at `PresetScorer.swift:86` + `PresetSignaling.swift:9-10`. **Approach validation:** continue into CA.5 with the App-layer scope-declaration tweak (CA.4 ended up reading several App files to verify call-site counts; the read was bounded but not pre-declared in scope). The audit format continues to produce actionable findings: 1 P1 BUG, 1 production-orphan, 1 unverified-claim, multiple doc-drift corrections, plus a load-bearing CA.1 re-scoping. **Recommended next subsystem: App layer** (`PhospheneApp/`) — BUG-015 lives there and the largest unaudited surface is the App. **Alternative:** defer CA.5 scope until BUG-015's diagnosis lands if findings motivate a different priority.

**Scope.** All 14 files in `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Orchestrator/` (~2,950 LoC) — scoring + policy core (3 files: PresetScorer, PresetScoringContext, TransitionPolicy), planning (3 files: SessionPlanner, SessionPlanner+Segments, PlannedSession), live adaptation (3 files: LiveAdapter, LiveAdapter+Patching, LiveAdapter+MoodOverride), reactive mode (1 file: ReactiveOrchestrator), signaling (2 files: PresetSignaling, ArachneStateSignaling), router + settings (2 files: PlaybackActionRouter, QualityCeiling). Boundary annotations: Orchestrator ↔ Session (TrackProfile + TrackIdentity consumption; PlannedSession.canonicalIdentity at the BUG-006.2 wiring site), Orchestrator ↔ DSP (StructuralPrediction as input parameter — never read from MIRPipeline directly), Orchestrator ↔ ML (MoodClassifier.currentState prep-time vs RenderPipeline.setMood runtime), Orchestrator ↔ App (the BUG-015 missing-wire surface), Orchestrator ↔ Renderer (QualityCeiling cross-module consumer), Orchestrator ↔ Presets (ArachneState conformance to PresetSignaling). Excluded by scope: `PhospheneApp/` (CA-App / CA.5 next), `Sources/Renderer/` MLDispatchScheduler (CA-Renderer later), `Sources/Audio/` (CA-Audio later), `Sources/Presets/` per-preset state types (CA-Presets later).

**Output.** `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ORCHESTRATOR.md` + 1 new BUG entry (BUG-015) + doc-drift corrections in the same increment.

**Discipline.** Audit-only. No code changes during the audit beyond the new audit doc, the BUG-015 entry, and the listed doc-drift / source-comment corrections. The 8 BUG-012-i1-instrumented files remained off-limits to edits per the Hard Rules carried forward from CA.2 — no Orchestrator file is BUG-012-i1-instrumented, so the rule was trivially satisfied.

**Done-when.** Audit document published; every public capability has a verdict; every `production-orphan` cites its grep; every non-`production-active` finding either ships a doc-fix in this increment or is registered as a `CA.4-FU-N` follow-up; CA.1 synthetic-StructuralPrediction re-evaluation has a final verdict + recommendation for CA.1-FU-1 (option (a), decoupled from BUG-015); D-120 revert verified clean; drift corrections to load-bearing docs landed; "Approach validation" section produces an honest critique of whether the format should continue into CA.5.

**After CA.4 lands** — surface to Matt: summary counts, BUG-015 P1 finding + recommended fix scoping, CA.1-FU-1 re-scoping verdict (ship option (a) standalone now), recommended approach changes for CA.5 (App-layer scope declaration), recommended next subsystem (App layer — BUG-015 lives there).

### Increment CA.5 — App Layer (engine-adapter slice)

**Status.** ✅ Landed 2026-05-21. Kickoff doc: commit `54357118`. Audit deliverable: [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP.md). Summary: 48 of 49 file-level entities `production-active`; **0 `broken-but-claimed`** (BUG-015 — the only App-layer-class broken-but-claimed finding in scope — was already Resolved 2026-05-21 in three commits before CA.5 began); **0 new BUG entries filed**. **BUG-015 wire shape verified clean** — all seven design notes from the Resolved field land byte-for-byte (cadence `orchestratorWireFrameDivisor: Int = 30` → ~3 Hz; lock-guarded `liveTrackPlanIndex` + `lastClassifiedMood` + `orchestratorWireLoggedThisTrack`; off-plan skip path; once-per-track diagnostic dual-writing to session.log + os.Logger; OrchestratorWiringRegressionTests source-presence regression with two `@Test` methods stripping comments before counting). **BUG-012-i1 instrumentation intact** across all 8 instrumented files (48 BUG012Probe references total); no edits per CA.5 Hard Rules. **BUG-016 App-layer surface inventoried** without proposing a fix: Lumen Mosaic apply path lives inside `case .rayMarch:` at +Presets.swift:166-178 gated on `desc.name == "Lumen Mosaic"`; slot-8 binding via setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3 correct per D-LM-buffer-slot-8; LumenPatternEngine init can return nil with failure logged to os.Logger only — recommend adding sessionRecorder?.log() on the failure branch for the next BUG-016 reproduction. **1 `production-orphan`** field-level — `MultiDisplayToastBridge.coalesceTask` + `pendingEvents` declared but never read/written (line-21 comment documents coalescing intent the code doesn't implement). Registered as CA.5-FU-1. **1 `unverified-claim`** — `LiveAdaptationToastBridge.swift:1-14` docstring claims engine-event observation source that has no production-wired consumer (CA.5-FU-2 surfaces this as a product call). **2 large `built-but-undocumented`** — `ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map PhospheneApp/` listed 15 of 49 engine-adapter files (34 missing); §Module Map Tests/PhospheneApp/ was absent entirely (60+ App tests). **1 file-naming drift** — `MusicKitFetcher.swift` contains `ITunesSearchFetcher`; recommend rename per CA.5-FU-3. **D-091 / Failed Approach #55 enforcement verified clean**; **U.10 @Suite(.serialized) verified** on the one URLProtocol-stub-using App test; **SwiftLint baseline**: zero warnings in PhospheneApp/ (18 remaining are engine-side, out of CA.5 scope). **CA.1-FU-1 status update**: the BUG-015 fix routes `liveBoundary` from `mirPipeline.latestStructuralPrediction` (option (b)) — the per-frame StructuralAnalyzer chain now has a runtime consumer; CA.1-FU-1 closes as `superseded`. Doc-drift corrections applied to `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§Module Map PhospheneApp/ block rewritten with all 49 engine-adapter files; PhospheneAppTests/ block added under Tests/ listing the load-bearing regression / contract tests). **Approach validation:** direct reads + parallel Explore agents both scaled cleanly; Pass 0 BUG-status cross-check found zero kickoff staleness; the cited-grep rule fired once and produced the field-level production-orphan with confidence; the BUG-015 wire-shape verification produced 10 concrete byte-level confirmations. **Recommended next subsystem: CA.6 — App Views + ViewModels** (59 files / 6,889 LoC; largest unaudited surface by file count; home of the U.10 / U.11 flake cluster).

**Scope.** Engine-adapter slice of `PhospheneApp/` — 49 files / 7,975 LoC. Top-level (14 files: VisualizerEngine + 11 extensions + ContentView + PhospheneApp + MusicKitFetcher), Services/ (30), Permissions/ (3), Models/ (2). Boundary annotations: App ↔ Orchestrator (BUG-015 wire + DefaultPlaybackActionRouter + PresetScoringContextProvider), App ↔ Session (SessionManager / StemCache / MetadataPreFetcher ownership), App ↔ DSP / MIR (MIRPipeline construction + per-frame consumer), App ↔ ML (MoodClassifier + StemSeparator + MLDispatchScheduler consumption), App ↔ Renderer (RenderPipeline + FrameBudgetManager + slot-6/7/8 buffer wiring), App ↔ Audio (AudioInputRouter + audio-thread → analysis-queue handoff), App ↔ Presets (per-preset state classes + setMeshPresetTick closures). Excluded by scope (deferred to CA.6): `PhospheneApp/Views/` (47 files including MetalView.swift) + `PhospheneApp/ViewModels/` (12 files). Excluded entirely (CA-Renderer / CA-Audio / CA-Presets later): `Sources/Renderer/`, `Sources/Audio/`, `Sources/Presets/`.

**Output.** `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP.md` + doc-drift corrections in the same increment. No new BUG entries.

**Discipline.** Audit-only. No code changes during the audit beyond the new audit doc and the listed doc-drift corrections. The 8 BUG-012-i1-instrumented files include the two App-layer files in CA.5's scope (`VisualizerEngine.swift` + `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift`) — read freely; NO edits made per CA.5 Hard Rules.

**Done-when.** Audit document published; sub-scope decision documented; every public capability in scope has a verdict; every Explore-agent-claimed public symbol cross-checked against visibility grep; every `production-orphan` cites its grep; every non-`production-active` finding either ships a doc-fix in this increment or is registered as a `CA.5-FU-N` follow-up; BUG-015 wire shape verified in §Verification-of-BUG-015-wire-shape; BUG-012-i1 instrumentation verified intact in §Verification-of-BUG-012-i1-instrumentation; drift corrections to load-bearing docs landed; no edits to BUG-012-i1 instrumented files; "Approach validation" section produces an honest critique of whether the format should continue into CA.6.

**After CA.5 lands** — surface to Matt: summary counts, BUG-015 wire-shape verification verdict (clean), BUG-012-i1 instrumentation intactness verdict (intact), BUG-016 App-layer surface inventory (no root cause from inventory alone; recommend log-line addition on LumenPatternEngine init-failure branch for the next reproduction), three CA.5-FU follow-ups (field-level orphan; engine-event observation docstring decision; ITunesSearchFetcher file rename), CA.1-FU-1 supersede update (BUG-015 fix routes from MIRPipeline → option (b) is in place, option (a) no longer needed), recommended next subsystem (CA.6 — App Views + ViewModels).

### Increment CA.6 — App Layer (Views + ViewModels presentation slice)

**Status.** ✅ Landed 2026-05-21. Kickoff doc: [`docs/prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA6_APP_VIEWS_2026-05-21.md`](prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA6_APP_VIEWS_2026-05-21.md). Audit deliverable: [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP_VIEWS.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP_VIEWS.md). Summary: 58 of 59 file-level entities `production-active`; **0 `broken-but-claimed`** (BUG-015 — the only App-layer-class broken-but-claimed finding in scope — was already Resolved 2026-05-21 in three commits before CA.5; CA.6 verifies the consumer chain matches the design); **0 new BUG entries filed**. **PlaybackChromeViewModel BUG-015 / D-091 consumer chain verified clean** — full producer-to-consumer trace from `VisualizerEngine.swift:77` (`@Published var currentTrackIndex: Int?`) through `+Capture.swift:152` (plan-resolution write) through `ContentView.swift:85` (publisher binding via `engine.$currentTrackIndex.eraseToAnyPublisher()`) through `PlaybackView.swift:74,90` (init relay) into `PlaybackChromeViewModel.swift:121,169-176` (publisher subscription) and `:242-254` (`refreshProgress()` direct consumer, no lowercased title+artist string match). Failed Approach #56 regression-grep returned zero hits. **D-091 single-SettingsStore enforcement verified clean across the entire View tree** — ONE legitimate `@StateObject SettingsStore()` at `PhospheneApp.swift:25`; ONE `@EnvironmentObject SettingsStore` consumer at `PlaybackView.swift:55`; all four Settings sub-sections take `SettingsViewModel` as `@ObservedObject`; SettingsView's custom `init(store:)` builds the VM as `@StateObject` with the store passed in (correct D-091 topology). **DASH.7 dashboard surface verified clean against D-088 / D-089** — 16 line-anchored confirmations: DarkVibrancyView backdrop (`.vibrantDark` + `.hudWindow`), 0.96α surface tint, 1px border stroke, `.colorScheme(.dark)` lock, 320pt width, throttle 33ms (~30Hz), `ingestForTest(_:)` test seam, 240-sample stem history, `.singleValue` D-089 inline form (label-left, 13pt mono right, frame 17pt), `.progressBar` value column 110pt with `.fixedSize`, no SF Symbols (status via valueText color), Clash Display Medium 15pt title, Epilogue Medium 11pt + 1.5 tracking labels. **U.10 / U.11 timing-margin compliance verified clean across all 9 widened test files** from the `[dev-2026-05-21-c]` + `[dev-2026-05-21-d]` chip — every margin meets or exceeds U.11 baselines (700ms wait for 300ms debounce; 250-400ms for connect/login); `@Suite(.serialized)` annotation present on both URLProtocol/keychain-stub-using suites (SpotifyOAuthTokenProviderTests, SpotifyKeychainStoreTests). **3 `unverified-claim` findings**: (1) `DashboardOverlayView.swift:10` file-header docstring claims "0.55α" surface tint but code at line 57 uses `.opacity(0.96)` — ARCHITECTURE.md / D-089 correctly say 0.96α; in-file docstring is stale (CA.6-FU-1). (2) `DashboardCardView.swift:5` file-header claims "Clash Display title at 18pt" but code resolves `TypeScale.bodyLarge` which is `15` — ARCHITECTURE.md correctly says 15pt; in-file docstring is stale (CA.6-FU-2). (3) `ConnectorPickerView.swift:111-115` creates `AppleMusicConnectionViewModel()` inline in the `@ViewBuilder` destination while the equivalent Spotify path uses `OAuthSpotifyConnectionWrapper` `@StateObject` to preserve VM across body re-evaluations — architectural inconsistency (CA.6-FU-3); production impact likely low (AM has no URL-callback foregrounding scenario), but worth either applying the wrapper pattern for consistency or documenting the rationale. **2 large `built-but-undocumented`**: (a) ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map PhospheneApp/Views/ block listed ~20 of 47 files (27 missing) + 3 §UI Layer paragraph drift items (NoAudioSignalBadge → ListeningBadgeView rename; missing Shift+→/←/Z/M/Esc/Shift+? shortcuts; DashboardOverlayView Layer 6 not mentioned); (b) §Module Map PhospheneApp/ViewModels/ block listed 4 of 12 (8 missing). Doc-drift corrections applied to ARCHITECTURE.md in this increment. **No `production-orphan` findings** — every public/internal type, every method has a production consumer (two candidates investigated and rejected: `AppleMusicConnectionViewModel.cancelRetry()` consumed at `AppleMusicConnectionView.swift:33`; `ReadyViewModel.planPreviewEnabled` consumed at `ReadyView.swift:142-143`). **CA.5-FU-1 + CA.5-FU-3 landed before CA.6 began** (commits `688095d4` + `b8952fda` per kickoff status-on-entry); CA.5-FU-2 (LiveAdaptationToastBridge engine-event docstring product call) remains pending — carried forward. **Approach validation:** direct reads + 3 parallel Explore agents scaled cleanly for 8.3k LoC (kickoff estimate 6.9k was ~20% low); D-091 enforcement grep produced confidence in one shot; PlaybackChromeViewModel consumer-chain trace produced 10 byte-level confirmations; DASH.7 verification produced 16 line-anchored confirmations; the U.10/U.11 table-based audit produced complete per-file compliance verdicts. **Recommended next subsystem: CA.7 — CA-Renderer** (`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/` is the largest unaudited engine module — FrameBudgetManager + RenderPipeline + MLDispatchScheduler + per-pass pipelines + Dashboard renderer). Alternative: CA-Audio (smaller; closes the AudioInputRouter + SilenceDetector + StreamingMetadata + MetadataPreFetcher surface CA.3 boundary-noted). The App layer is now fully closed.

**Scope.** App-layer Views + ViewModels presentation slice — 59 files / 8,285 LoC (kickoff's 6.9k estimate undercounted by ~20%). `PhospheneApp/Views/` (47 files across 9 subdirectories + root-level) + `PhospheneApp/ViewModels/` (12 files); plus `DashboardOverlayViewModel.swift` which lives in `Views/Dashboard/` per the filesystem layout. Boundary annotations: View ↔ App-Service (PlaybackView owns 8 `@State` services CA.5 audited from the engine side); View ↔ VisualizerEngine (publisher-injection pattern via `engine.$xxx.eraseToAnyPublisher()` from ContentView); ViewModel ↔ SessionManager (SessionStateViewModel via Combine `.assign(to: \.state, on: self)`; ReadyViewModel / PreparationProgressViewModel / EndSessionConfirmViewModel take SessionManager as init param); ViewModel ↔ SettingsStore (read via `@ObservedObject SettingsViewModel`; never via direct `@StateObject SettingsStore`); ViewModel ↔ DSP / ML (via `DashboardSnapshot` consumed by DashboardOverlayViewModel). Excluded by scope (deferred to CA.7+): `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/` (CA-Renderer next), `Sources/Audio/` (CA-Audio later), `Sources/Presets/` per-preset state types (CA-Presets later).

**Output.** `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP_VIEWS.md` + doc-drift corrections in the same increment (ARCHITECTURE.md §UI Layer paragraph + §Module Map Views/ block + §Module Map ViewModels/ block). No new BUG entries.

**Discipline.** Audit-only. No code changes during the audit beyond the new audit doc and the listed doc-drift corrections. The 8 BUG-012-i1-instrumented files are out of CA.6 scope (none are in `Views/` or `ViewModels/`) — Hard Rule trivially satisfied.

**Done-when.** Audit document published; sub-scope decision documented (no split; 59 files fit cleanly); every public/internal capability in scope has a verdict; every Explore-agent-claimed public symbol cross-checked against visibility grep; every `production-orphan` cites its grep (zero found in this audit); every non-`production-active` finding either ships a doc-fix in this increment or is registered as a `CA.6-FU-N` follow-up; the four kickoff-required verifications complete (PlaybackChromeViewModel BUG-015/D-091 consumer chain, D-091 single-SettingsStore enforcement, DASH.7 dashboard surface, U.10/U.11 timing-margin compliance); drift corrections to load-bearing docs landed; no edits to BUG-012-i1 instrumented files; "Approach validation" section produces an honest critique of whether the format should continue into CA.7.

**After CA.6 lands** — surface to Matt: summary counts; PlaybackChromeViewModel BUG-015 / D-091 consumer chain verdict (clean — matches design byte-for-byte); D-091 single-SettingsStore enforcement verdict (clean across View tree); DASH.7 dashboard surface verdict (clean against D-088 / D-089 with two file-header docstring drifts flagged); U.10 / U.11 timing-margin compliance verdict (clean across all 9 widened test files); three CA.6-FU follow-ups (DashboardOverlayView docstring drift; DashboardCardView docstring drift; ConnectorPickerView Apple-Music inline VM consistency question); CA.5-FU-2 carried forward (still pending Matt's product call); recommended next subsystem (CA.7 — CA-Renderer). The App layer is now fully closed.

### Increment CA.7a — Renderer Capability Audit (core pipeline) ✅ (2026-05-21)

**Status.** ✅ Landed 2026-05-21. Kickoff doc: [`docs/prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA7_RENDERER_2026-05-21.md`](prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA7_RENDERER_2026-05-21.md). Audit deliverable: [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/RENDERER.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/RENDERER.md). 23 files / 5,413 Swift LoC covering the load-bearing per-frame render dispatch path: `RenderPipeline` + 10 extensions (`+Draw`, `+MeshDraw`, `+PostProcess`, `+FeedbackDraw`, `+RayMarch`, `+MVWarp`, `+ICB`, `+Staged`, `+BudgetGovernor`, `+PresetSwitching`), `RayMarchPipeline` + 2 extensions (`+Passes`, `+PipelineStates`), `FrameBudgetManager`, `MLDispatchScheduler` (BUG-012-i1 read-only), `MetalContext`, `IBLManager`, `TextureManager`, `PostProcessChain`, `ShaderLibrary`, `DynamicTextOverlay`, `Protocols`. **All five required verifications clean**: (1) GPU contract slot reservations match code byte-for-byte across 9 buffer slots + 9 documented texture slots (slot 12 + slot 13+ surfaced as built-but-undocumented and added in this increment); (2) MLDispatchScheduler 5-rule `decide(context:)` algorithm matches D-059 spec line-by-line + Tier 1/2 deferral caps (2000ms/30 frames + 1500ms/20 frames); (3) FrameBudgetManager 30-frame rolling window + 180-frame upshift hysteresis + 14ms/16ms per-tier targets + 3 consecutive overruns to downshift + `resetRecentFrameBuffer()` for D-061a all match the BUG-011-closure-load-bearing spec; (4) mv_warp accumulator dispatch path (D-027) correct against AuroraVeilMVWarpAccumulationTest — marginal parity gap (test reimplements the pass sequence rather than calling `drawWithMVWarp(...)` directly — CA.7-FU-1); (5) Failed Approach #66 test/prod parity clean — `renderDeferredRayMarch` fixture helper accepts `useMeshPath: Bool = false` matching live's nil meshGBufferEncoder + round-57 SDF default. **One dead-code cluster surfaced**: `RayMarchPipeline.depthDebugEnabled` / `runDepthDebugPass` / `depthDebugPipeline` (CA.7-FU-2 — safe to delete). **Two production-orphan clusters surfaced**: (a) entire ICB infrastructure (`IndirectCommandBufferState` / `ICBConfiguration` / `setICBState` / `drawWithICB` / `RenderPass.icb` / `ICB.metal`) — test-active via `RenderPipelineICBTests` but no preset declares `"icb"` and no production setICBState call, deliberately deferred per VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:305 comment ("ICB preset switching deferred to the Orchestrator increment"), boundary-noted at App ↔ Renderer (CA.7-FU-3 keep-or-retire decision); (b) `setRayMarchPresetComputeDispatch(_:)` kept-by-design for V.9 Session 4.5b Phase 2b revival but deactivated at Phase 1 round 4 (particles pinned, one-shot bake sufficient — VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:265-267 comment), low-priority CA.7-FU-4 keep-or-retire. **Doc drifts fixed in this increment**: ARCH §Renderer line 184-185 buffer summary was inverted (FFT/waveform/FeatureVector/StemFeatures order with "4-7=future" — both wrong) → rewritten to canonical FeatureVector/FFT/waveform/StemFeatures order with slot 4/5/6/7/8 assignments noted; ARCH §Module Map Renderer/ block missed 7 of 23 CA.7a-scope files (`RenderPipeline+FeedbackDraw`, `+Staged`, `+BudgetGovernor`, `+PresetSwitching`, `RayMarchPipeline+PipelineStates`, `DynamicTextOverlay`, `Protocols`) → all added with one-line behavioural descriptions; ARCH §GPU Contract Details §Texture Binding Layout extended with slot 12 (DynamicTextOverlay direct-pass) + slot 13+ (staged-composition sampled outputs via `kStagedSampledTextureFirstSlot = 13`); ARCH §GPU Contract Details §Buffer Binding Layout extended with the slot 4 mesh-shader path reuse note (mutually exclusive with ray-march's SceneUniforms). **Zero new BUG entries filed**; every load-bearing claim in CLAUDE.md / ARCHITECTURE.md / DECISIONS.md matches the code. **Recommended next subsystem: CA.7b** — Dashboard/ + Geometry/ + RayTracing/ (15 files / 2,241 LoC). Alternative: CA-Audio (smaller; closes the CA.3 boundary-noted item).

**Scope.** 23 files / 5,413 LoC (kickoff's 22-file / 7.5k estimate was +1 file low and ~38 % over LoC; future kickoff drafters should `wc -l` the scope before writing the estimate; methodology unaffected). Sub-scope decision: option (b) split — CA.7a (core pipeline) now, CA.7b (supporting: Dashboard / Geometry / RayTracing) next.

**Done-when.** RENDERER.md published; every public/internal capability in scope has a verdict; every Explore-agent-claimed public symbol cross-checked against visibility grep (clean across all 9 batched files); every `production-orphan` cites its grep + result count (2 clusters cited); the five kickoff-required verifications complete with line-anchored confirmations; drift corrections to ARCH §Renderer / §Module Map / §GPU Contract Details landed in this increment; no edits to BUG-012-i1 instrumented files (MLDispatchScheduler.swift respected); "Approach validation" section produces an honest critique of whether the format should continue into CA.7b.

**After CA.7a lands** — surface to Matt: 5 verification verdicts (all clean modulo CA.7-FU-1 parity tightening); ICB cluster keep-or-retire decision (CA.7-FU-3); `setRayMarchPresetComputeDispatch` keep-or-retire decision (CA.7-FU-4); dead-code cleanup (CA.7-FU-2 — small, mechanical); recommended next subsystem (CA.7b). The CA.7b row stays open as the natural next increment.

### Increment CA.7b — Renderer Capability Audit (Dashboard / Geometry / RayTracing) ✅ (2026-05-21)

**Status.** ✅ Landed 2026-05-21. Kickoff doc: [`docs/prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA7B_RENDERER_SUPPORTING_2026-05-21.md`](prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA7B_RENDERER_SUPPORTING_2026-05-21.md). Audit deliverable: [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/RENDERER_SUPPORTING.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/RENDERER_SUPPORTING.md). 15 files / 2,241 LoC across Renderer/Dashboard/ (8 files — DASH.7 producer side) + Renderer/Geometry/ (4 files — particle-geometry siblings + mesh-shader dispatch) + Renderer/RayTracing/ (3 files — hardware ray-tracing scaffold). **All four kickoff-required verifications complete**: (1) DASH.7 producer-side **clean against D-087 / D-088 / D-089 + CA.6's 16 line-anchored confirmations** — full chain trace from `VisualizerEngine+Dashboard.publishDashboardSnapshot` through `DashboardSnapshot` `@Published` + `.throttle(33ms)` into `BeatCardBuilder` / `StemsCardBuilder` / `PerfCardBuilder` (each with per-row D-088/D-089 colour + contrast confirmations); `PerfSnapshot.zero` `targetFrameMs: 14` matches `assemblePerfSnapshot` Tier 1 fallback; 240-sample `StemEnergyHistory.capacity` matches `MutableStemHistory` ring buffer. (2) D-097 particle-geometry siblings **clean** — `ParticleGeometry` protocol surface (AnyObject + Sendable, 3 required members) matches spec at `ParticleGeometry.swift:33-79`; `RenderPipeline.particleGeometry: (any ParticleGeometry)?` storage at `RenderPipeline.swift:31`; `ProceduralGeometry` has zero parameterisation hits (CLAUDE.md §What NOT To Do invariant honoured); `ParticleGeometryRegistry.knownPresetNames = ["Murmuration"]` sole entry post-Drift Motes retirement (D-102); `ParticleDispatchRegistryTests` catalog gate confirmed. (3) MeshGenerator D-051 dispatch **clean** — `device.supportsFamily(.apple8)` gate at init + `usesMeshShaderPath` branch at every draw call; `drawMeshThreadgroups` (M3+) vs `drawPrimitives(.triangle, 3)` (M1/M2); slot-4 mesh-shader-path reuse per CA.7a ARCH extension confirmed (MeshGenerator does NOT touch fragment slot 4; that's RenderPipeline+MeshDraw's `meshPresetFragmentBuffer` binding territory). (4) RayTracing **`production-orphan` + `boundary-noted`** — zero production consumers across `PhospheneApp/` + `PhospheneEngine/Sources/` (only test-side `BVHBuilderTests` + `RayIntersectorTests` plus one documentation comment cross-reference at `Sources/Shared/AudioFeatures+SceneUniforms.swift:9`); planned consumer is `Arachne3D` per D-096 V.8.0-spec (V.8.x deferred per Matt's 2026-05-08 sequencing call). **Recommended keep-by-design** analogous to CA.7-FU-3's ICB resolution; filed as CA.7b-FU-3 for Matt's keep/retire decision. **Cross-reference finding (CA.7a-scope, surfaced from CA.7b inspection)**: latent slot-1 collision between `RenderPipeline+MeshDraw.swift:65-67` (`meshPresetBuffer` at object/mesh slot 1) and `MeshGenerator.draw()` `:204-205` (`densityMultiplier` at the same slot). `setMeshPresetBuffer(_:)` + `setMeshPresetFragmentBuffer(_:)` have **zero non-nil production callers** — the only call site is the `pipeline.setMeshPresetBuffer(nil)` reset at `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:55`. Filed as CA.7b-FU-4 (latent, low-priority; recommended retirement following CA.7-FU-4 precedent). **Doc-drift fixes landed in this increment**: ARCH §Module Map Renderer/Dashboard/ block had `DashboardTextLayer` (line 564) + `DashboardCardRenderer` (line 566) entries despite DASH.7 retirement (D-087) — both deleted; ARCH §Module Map Renderer/Geometry/ block missed `ParticleGeometryRegistry` — inserted with one-line behavioural description; ARCH §Renderer/Dashboard/PerfSnapshot line 569 claimed `MLDispatchScheduler.lastDecision / forceDispatchCount` but PerfSnapshot has no `forceDispatchCount` field — rewritten as decision-code + retry-ms; `DashboardCardLayout` line 565 + `DashboardFontLoader` line 563 extended with `.timeseries` row variant + Clash Display font + post-DASH.7.1 surface descriptions; RayTracing entries (lines 561-562) extended with production-orphan + planned-consumer notes. **Zero new BUG entries filed**. **Approach validation**: direct-read at 2.2k LoC scaled cleanly; the "non-nil caller" production-orphan check at setter granularity is a new pattern worth carrying forward into CA-Audio / CA-Presets (CA.7a verified setters had any callers; CA.7b's slot-1 discovery happened because non-nil callers were checked specifically). ARCH §Module Map drift is now a 4-in-a-row systemic finding across CA.5/6/7a/7b — recommend a future bulk pass against `find` output rather than continuing one-or-two-items-per-increment. **Recommended next subsystem: CA-Audio** (`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/` — closes the CA.3 boundary-noted item). Alternative: CA-Presets (per-preset state classes under Sources/Presets/). Renderer is now fully audited (CA.7a core + CA.7b supporting = 38 files / 7,654 LoC); the only remaining unaudited engine modules are Audio + Presets.

**Scope.** `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/Dashboard/` (8 files / 766 LoC — DASH.7 producer side: BeatCardBuilder / StemsCardBuilder / PerfCardBuilder / DashboardCardLayout / DashboardSnapshot / DashboardFontLoader / StemEnergyHistory / PerfSnapshot), `Renderer/Geometry/` (4 files / 727 LoC — MeshGenerator / ParticleGeometry / ParticleGeometryRegistry / ProceduralGeometry), `Renderer/RayTracing/` (3 files / 748 LoC — BVHBuilder / RayIntersector / RayIntersector+Internal). Total: 15 files / 2,241 LoC. Sub-scope decision: single-pass (kickoff's default at this size).

**Carry-forward.** **CA.7b-FU-3 — Resolved 2026-05-21 (keep)**: Matt's product call — keep RayTracing infrastructure in place. Rationale: *"it will be used eventually by presets we haven't created yet"* (Matt 2026-05-21). D-096 Arachne3D toolkit citation + V.8.7+ BVH refraction documented planned consumers, plus other future ray-tracing-using presets not yet specced. Registry-only resolution; no code change. **CA.7b-FU-4 (open, low-priority)**: `setMeshPresetBuffer` / `setMeshPresetFragmentBuffer` zero-non-nil-caller cleanup (recommendation: deprecate + remove, following CA.7-FU-4 `setRayMarchPresetComputeDispatch` precedent; latent slot-1 collision documented in audit deliverable §Verification of MeshGenerator D-051 dispatch). CA.7-FU-1 + CA.7-FU-2 (mv_warp test reachability + depth-debug dead-code removal) remain open from CA.7a — out of CA.7b scope; carried forward unchanged.

### Increment CA-Audio — Audio Capability Audit

**Status.** Kickoff doc landed 2026-05-21 ([`docs/prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA_AUDIO_2026-05-21.md`](prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA_AUDIO_2026-05-21.md)). Audit itself pending Matt's scheduling — hand the kickoff to a fresh Claude Code session when ready. CA.7b closeout 2026-05-21 recommended CA-Audio as the natural next increment (closes the CA.3 Session ↔ Audio boundary-noted item; smaller than CA-Presets).

**Scope.** `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/` — 16 files / 3,294 LoC across capture pipeline (6 files: `SystemAudioCapture`, `AudioInputRouter`, `AudioInputRouter+SignalState`, `AudioBuffer`, `LookaheadBuffer`, `FFTProcessor`), signal-quality monitors (2 files: `SilenceDetector`, `InputLevelMonitor`), metadata fetcher cluster (6 files: `MetadataPreFetcher`, `MusicBrainzFetcher`, `SpotifyFetcher`, `SoundchartsFetcher`, `MusicKitBridge`, `StreamingMetadata`), protocols (1 file: `Protocols.swift`), module marker (1 file: `Audio.swift`).

**Required verifications** carried forward from CA.3 / CA.5 / CA.7b observations: (1) CA.3 Session ↔ Audio boundary closure — `MetadataPreFetcher` producer-side traced against the Session consumer chain at `SessionPreparer.swift:86, 132, 299`; (2) D-079 sample-rate plumbing — cited literal-grep against `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` allowlist + immutable-capture confirmation at `AudioInputRouter.installTap(...)`; (3) tap recovery state machine matches ARCH §68 (3 s → 10 s → 30 s backoff, three attempts); (4) SilenceDetector + InputLevelMonitor timings match ARCH §487-488 (.active → .suspect 1.5s → .silent 3s → .recovering → .active 0.5s hold; 21s peak-dBFS window + 30-frame hysteresis); (5) Failed Approach #21 + #22 verified at `SystemAudioCapture` source; (6) BUG-005 + BUG-013 producer-side handling characterised.

**Same methodology as CA.1-CA.7b** (audit-only; sub-scope decision unnecessary at 3.3k LoC; visibility grep verification; cited grep for production-orphan claims; non-nil-caller refinement for setter APIs per CA.7b; per-file verdicts; doc-drift corrections in the same increment).

---

## Phase CS — Cold-Start Sync (2026-05-20)

**Motivation.** Matt 2026-05-20: "The product should be at least beat-synced from frame 1, having 1s of wonky performance while the transition occurs is acceptable but this should be the only session wonkiness." This is restated as the load-bearing commercial-viability bar for the listening-party use case (collaborative Spotify playlists of novel tracks). If we cannot meet it, the product is not viable as conceived.

**Design + adversarial review:** [`docs/COLD_START_SYNC_DESIGN_2026-05-20.md`](COLD_START_SYNC_DESIGN_2026-05-20.md). All five increments below trace to that document. **Read it before scoping any CS increment.**

**Surprise from the design pass.** Most of the C2 + first-onset-anchor proposal sketched in the 2026-05-20 design conversation **already exists in production code**, built incrementally across the BUG-007.x series:

- `BeatGrid.offsetBy(_:horizon:)` extrapolates beats 300 s forward (`PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/BeatGrid.swift:120`).
- `GridOnsetCalibrator` measures per-track grid-vs-onset offset at preparation time (`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/GridOnsetCalibrator.swift`).
- `LiveBeatDriftTracker.setGrid(_:initialDriftMs:)` seeds the drift EMA with the calibrated value at track install (`PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/LiveBeatDriftTracker.swift:408`).
- BUG-007.9 hybrid runtime re-calibration refines the calibration against actual tap audio after ~15 s.

The remaining work is **verification + targeted filling**, not new architecture. See design doc §4 (what exists) and §5 (what's unverified) for the full picture.

### Increment CS.1 — Empirical verification of existing cold-start beat sync ✅

**Status: complete (2026-05-22). Verdict: FAIL — 3 of 10 tracks pass** the ±50 ms / 90 % bar (session `2026-05-22T16-57-36Z`). Pass-rate < 90 % → per the done-when, the increment surfaced the failure cases; CS.1.x diagnosed them.

**Scope (as built).** A new sibling executable target `ColdStartVerifier` (`PhospheneEngine/Sources/ColdStartVerifier/`) — NOT an extension of `PresetSessionReplay` (it needs `DSP` / `ML` / `Session`, which the preset-rubric tool does not depend on). The final measurement design (option C, after several iterations in commits `27c76c47` → `989f81a5`): visual beat = `beatPhase01` wraps in `features.csv`; audible beat = a Beat This! one-beat-per-beat grid re-detected offline from a per-track slice of `raw_tap.wav`; the raw-tap ↔ playback-time clock offset is pinned via a precise raw-tap-start timestamp added to `SessionRecorder` (commit `1e2e47fa`). Output: per-track `(visual − audible)` delta distribution + `cold_start_report.md` evidence pack.

**Done-when (met).** Harness built + self-tested + run end-to-end against a real session; per-track `pass`/`fail`/`degenerate` verdicts emitted; pass-rate < 90 % → failures surfaced, CS.1.x diagnoses before CS.2.

### Increment CS.1.x — Cold-start grid-phase diagnosis ✅

**Status: complete (2026-05-22).** Diagnosis-only increment (Defect Handling Protocol multi-increment process). Filed **BUG-017** in `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

**Finding.** The 7 failing tracks carry a per-track *systematic* phase offset (−128 to +338 ms, all within ±½-beat; within-track tight — MAD ~15 ms — a clean phase error, not jitter). Root cause: the cold-start grid is installed `cached.beatGrid.offsetBy(0)` (`VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift:485`) — Beat This! on the 30 s Spotify preview clip, with the preview's timeline used as the track's timeline verbatim. The preview is an arbitrary excerpt, so the grid's phase is off by an arbitrary per-track amount. `GridOnsetCalibrator` runs on the preview (not the live track start) so it cannot correct it; the live drift EMA makes no gross phase jump; the BUG-007.9 recalibration fires only after the 10 s window and its ±200 ms cap discards large offsets. Full root cause in BUG-017.

**Done-when (met).** Root cause identified with code-level evidence; documented in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (BUG-017); no fix code.

### Increment BSAudit.3 — BPM-anchored phase acquisition design + impl + validate + close ✅ (resolved against accepted limit; impl runtime reverted 2026-05-25 evening)

**Status: complete (2026-05-25). Outcome: BUG-017 Resolved against accepted structural limit per Matt's Choice A decision.** The ±60 ms / 3 s perceptual sync sub-goal of the original Phase CS bar is retired as structurally unachievable. CLAUDE.md gains §Cold-Start Phase Contract + Failed Approach #69. **AMENDED 2026-05-26 — the BSAudit.3.impl runtime that the initial closeout retained as production was reverted same evening** (see BSAudit.3.revert sub-increment below). Production is the pre-impl baseline; the structural-limit acceptance still holds. See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-25-a]` (with 2026-05-26 amendment) and `[dev-2026-05-26-b]` for the full narrative.

**Sub-increments:**

- **BSAudit.3.design ✅** (`19a49db0`, 2026-05-24) — design doc `docs/BPM_ANCHORED_PHASE_ACQUISITION_DESIGN_2026-05-24.md`; three open decisions resolved (soft ramp; default `phaseAcquisitionDifficulty` formula; dual-candidate octave-risk).
- **BSAudit.3.impl.1 ✅** (`efaf8cb4`, 2026-05-24, **reverted by `002b5f2b` 2026-05-25**) — DSP/Session foundation: broadband peak detector + `RhythmCharacter` metadata (no behaviour change).
- **BSAudit.3.impl.2 ✅** (`13d0f456`, 2026-05-24, **reverted by `6758a617` 2026-05-25**) — `LiveBeatDriftTracker` BPM-prior + broadband-peak phase acquisition + confidence-gated accents.
- **BSAudit.3.impl.3 ✅** (`30d032ea`, 2026-05-24, **reverted by `33cd57e9` 2026-05-25**) — integration: install BPM prior, gate accents by confidence, retire `GridOnsetCalibrator`.
- **BSAudit.3.validate.1 ✅** (`515f9b89`, 2026-05-25) — verifier: `accent_confidence` in features.csv + `--accent-window-pass-rate` mode + 2 new self-test cases (PASS 11/11). (Verifier mode retained through revert; CSV column removed by `35305b5e`.)
- **BSAudit.3.validate.2 ✅** (`cf83037c`, 2026-05-25) — historical baseline: `--accent-window-pass-rate` against 3 pre-impl reference captures (cap1 absent on disk); summary doc at [`docs/diagnostics/BSAUDIT_3_HISTORICAL_BASELINE_2026-05-25.md`](diagnostics/BSAUDIT_3_HISTORICAL_BASELINE_2026-05-25.md). All 30 pre-impl samples PASS-firing at ≥ 95 %.
- **BSAudit.3.validate.3 + diag.1 ✅** (`346f7487`, 2026-05-25) — fresh post-impl capture `2026-05-25T15-20-49Z`; verifier reads **FAIL — 4/10 pass**. Verifier extended with per-track diagnostic block (first broadband peak time/residual, first accent fire time/residual, confidence/lock-state timings, per-fire residual distribution). Root-cause findings at [`docs/diagnostics/BSAUDIT_3_VALIDATE_3_DIAG_2026-05-25.md`](diagnostics/BSAUDIT_3_VALIDATE_3_DIAG_2026-05-25.md): three structural failures (wrong-anchor lock on broadband flux; confidence accumulator doesn't back-pressure; metric is gameable by over-firing).
- **BSAudit.3.close ✅** (`438edbbb`, 2026-05-25 afternoon) — Matt's Choice A: accept structural limit + document. CLAUDE.md §Cold-Start Phase Contract + Failed Approach #69 + What NOT To Do entry; KNOWN_ISSUES BUG-017 → Resolved with three closeout addenda; RELEASE_NOTES `[dev-2026-05-25-a]`; BEAT_SYNC.md closeout addendum; HISTORICAL_DEAD_ENDS entry. (Initial closeout retained the impl as production — subsequently reverted same evening.)
- **BSAudit.3.revert ✅** (commits `33cd57e9` / `6758a617` / `002b5f2b` / `35305b5e`, 2026-05-25 evening) — three `git revert` commits + one companion commit dropping the `accent_confidence` CSV column. Matt's "yes, keep the tools" sign-off retained the diagnostic infrastructure (`--accent-window-pass-rate` mode, the 4 new SelfTest checks, diagnostic findings doc, historical baseline doc); the impl runtime returned to the pre-impl baseline.
- **BSAudit.3.revert.docs ✅** (this commit, 2026-05-26) — doc-state alignment: CLAUDE.md §Cold-Start Phase Contract rewritten to describe the post-revert production state; CLAUDE.md FA #69 + What NOT To Do annotated; KNOWN_ISSUES BUG-017 + RELEASE_NOTES `[dev-2026-05-25-a]` + HISTORICAL_DEAD_ENDS + BEAT_SYNC.md + this plan entry + the design doc + the diag findings annotated with the revert. New `[dev-2026-05-26-b]` release notes entry documents the doc-correction increment.

**Outcome at the design level.** Six iterations (CS.1 → CS.1.y.2 → CS.1.y re-diag → CS.1.y.2-redo r1+r2 → BSAudit.3.impl) exhausted the available short-window automated signals for cold-start beat-phase derivation. None converged on > 70 % of catalog. The premise that some automated signal in the first ~3 s reliably gives audible beat phase is empirically falsified. Production contract (post-2026-05-25 revert) is the pre-impl baseline as documented in CLAUDE.md §Cold-Start Phase Contract: continuous-energy from frame 1, cached BeatGrid install via `MIRPipeline.setBeatGrid`, `LiveBeatDriftTracker` pre-impl form, `GridOnsetCalibrator` reinstated, ungated beat accents; what's accepted as unattainable is per-track ±60 ms perceptual lock within 3 s from automated tap-audio analysis alone.

**Done-when (met).** All seven runtime sub-increments shipped and (for impl) reverted; doc-state alignment shipped under BSAudit.3.revert.docs; CLAUDE.md / KNOWN_ISSUES / RELEASE_NOTES / BEAT_SYNC.md / HISTORICAL_DEAD_ENDS / this plan / the design doc / the diag findings all describe the post-revert state honestly; verifier diagnostic infrastructure persists for any future related work; six-iteration pattern documented as Failed Approach #69 for future-Claude.

### Increment BSAudit.2 — Path A research (Beat This!-on-tap reproducibility) ✅

**Status: complete (2026-05-24).** Research-only — no production code touched. Two new `ColdStartVerifier` modes (`--position-sweep` for within-capture, `--cross-capture` for across captures) + new modules ([`BeatPhaseStats.swift`](../PhospheneEngine/Sources/ColdStartVerifier/BeatPhaseStats.swift), [`PositionSweep.swift`](../PhospheneEngine/Sources/ColdStartVerifier/PositionSweep.swift), [`PositionSweepReport.swift`](../PhospheneEngine/Sources/ColdStartVerifier/PositionSweepReport.swift), [`CrossCapture.swift`](../PhospheneEngine/Sources/ColdStartVerifier/CrossCapture.swift), [`CrossCaptureReport.swift`](../PhospheneEngine/Sources/ColdStartVerifier/CrossCaptureReport.swift), [`ColdStartVerifierCommand+PathA.swift`](../PhospheneEngine/Sources/ColdStartVerifier/ColdStartVerifierCommand+PathA.swift)) running on the four reference captures.

**Outcome: Path A empirically falsified.** Within-capture: 7 of 10 tracks position-unstable (100-410 ms phase spread across 25 s slice positions in the same audio). Cross-capture: 10 of 10 tracks differ by 100-322 ms across the 4 captures at the same playback-time. No 25 s slice configuration of Beat This!-on-tap is a stable reference. Full evidence in [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md` §Addendum — BSAudit.2 (Path A) findings](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md#addendum--bsaudit2-path-a-findings-2026-05-24).

**Implication.** BSAudit-FU-5 Path A is **closed (falsified)**; Path B (human-tap ground truth) is now load-bearing for any future BUG-017 fix-claim that depends on automated verification. Two product-strategy options remain: (1) build Path B (small CLI + ~4 min of Matt's taps); (2) accept the structural limit and adopt the 2026-05-22 "approximately synced immediately, locked within ~20 s" framing as canonical. Matt's call.

**Done-when (met).** Within-capture + cross-capture measurements published; per-capture reports written; BSAudit-FU-5 Path A verdict published; FU-5 Path B promoted in the follow-up backlog.

**Verification.**
- Engine suite: **1265 / 1265 pass** (pre-BSAudit.2 baseline preserved).
- `ColdStartVerifier --self-test`: PASS (7/7).
- Project-wide `swiftlint --strict`: 0 violations across 386 files.
- 4 capture-level reports + 1 cross-capture report written to session directories.

### Increment BSAudit — Beat-Sync Audit (BUG-017 diagnosis stage) ✅

**Status: complete (2026-05-24).** Audit-only; no fix code. Deliverable: [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md). Six components scoped per the kickoff (prep-time grid + onset-offset seeding; cold-start grid install; live drift EMA; EMA under wrong-phase grids; verifier clock-offset; sub-bass onset feed); per-component verdicts with empirical grounding from the four reference captures (`2026-05-22T16-57-36Z` through `2026-05-24T15-07-31Z`).

**Headline findings.**
1. **The "beat-sync infrastructure is not perceptually aligned across the catalog" symptom is compound**, not single-rooted: a *static* per-track phase offset on syncopated tracks (the original BUG-017) plus *cross-capture variability* of the verification reference itself (a new finding).
2. **Beat This! on a 25 s live-tap slice is not cross-capture reproducible** on 5-6 of 10 catalog tracks — the dominant cause of the CS.1.y.2-redo cycle's verifier-passing→M7-failing pattern. The redo.1 "10/10 viable at 15 s" measurement validated within-slice reproducibility, not the production case.
3. **Failed Approach #68 is still live at prep time** in `GridOnsetCalibrator` — sub-bass-onset-vs-grid alignment used as a beat-phase reference. Same architectural mistake the CS.1.y.2 runtime fix attempted; not yet retired at prep.
4. **The live drift EMA's behaviour under a wrong-phase grid is bimodal:** sub-50ms-off → biases drift toward off-beat onsets (Regime A wobble); >50ms-off → rejects all onsets, drift parks at seed (Regime B stuck-off-beat). Both visible in cap1 baseline without any synthetic injection.

**Per-component verdicts and ranked root-cause hypotheses are in the [`BEAT_SYNC.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md) document. BUG-017's symptom statement was refined in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` against the audit findings.** Per-component fix scope sketches surfaced as a follow-up backlog (BSAudit-FU-1 through FU-6), none authorized; **Matt sign-off on direction is the next step**, not another fix increment.

**Done-when (met).** Per-component verdicts published with empirical grounding; six specific empirical questions either answered from the existing captures or surfaced as gaps requiring instrumentation; ranked root-cause hypotheses table; per-component fix scope sketches.

### Increment CS.1.y — Cold-start grid-phase fix (BUG-017) — **CS.1.y.2-redo reverted 2026-05-24; superseded by BSAudit; awaiting direction decision**

**Status (2026-05-22).** Three signal sources for the ≤ 5 s phase acquisition were tried and exhausted; Matt set a new direction ("approx now, exact by ~20 s"); the design landed; redo.1 measurement + redo.2 implementation are in tree; redo.3 validation is pending Matt's fresh capture + M7.

- **CS.1.y.1 design ✅** — original design surfaced; budget ratified.
- **CS.1.y.2 (onset-based fix) — failed, reverted.** Commit `dbcc018d` reverted by `f71b0456`. ColdStartVerifier 0/10. Sub-bass onset detector is not a beat-phase reference (CLAUDE.md Failed Approach #68).
- **CS.1.y re-diagnosis (short-window Beat This!) — done.** `ColdStartVerifier --rediagnose` (commit `b27226d3`) found 3/4/5 s windows unusable (1-3/10, non-reproducible).
- **Direction decision (Matt, 2026-05-22).** "Approx now, exact by ~20 s." Cached grid stays from frame 1 ("approx"); at ~15-20 s full-window live Beat This! phase-corrects the grid ("exact").
- **CS.1.y.2-redo design ✅** — design surfaced to Matt; snap = instant snap; W to be measured before code; the fix swaps the *measurement tool* inside BUG-007.9's `runtimeRecalibrationIfDue` (BUG-007.9 structure stays — one-shot per track, `applyCalibration` apply path, `runtimeRecalibrationDone` latch); `GridOnsetCalibrator` survives for its prep-time `gridOnsetOffsetMs` seed only.
- **CS.1.y.2-redo redo.1 (measurement) ✅** — `ColdStartVerifier --rediagnose` extended to take `--rediagnose-windows` (default `3,4,5` preserved). Run on both captures with `10,15,20`. Result decisive: phase reproducibly ≤ 8 ms at 15 s, ≤ 6 ms at 20 s across both captures and every test track including HUMBLE and Money. **W = 15 s ratified** (Matt). Capture reports written: `<capture>/cold_start_rediagnosis_10-15-20.md`.
- **CS.1.y.2-redo redo.2 (implementation) ✅** — engine method `applyColdStartPhaseCorrection`, app rework, buffer bump, verifier `--window-start-s`. **Subsequently reverted 2026-05-24** — see redo.3 below.
- **CS.1.y.2-redo redo.3 (validation) ✗ — three captures, no convergence; CS.1.y.2-redo reverted.** Capture 1 (`2026-05-23T02-17-24Z`) surfaced an engine bug (default `horizon: 300` extrapolation inflated residuals) → fix `1e77fdf6` (`horizon: 0`). Capture 2 (`2026-05-23T02-39-54Z`): signatures clean but 2 regressions on previously-passing tracks (Get Lucky 95 % → 0 %; SNA worse) — high-R confident-but-wrong measurements, the CS.1.y.2 R-gate failure (Failed Approach #68) reappearing in Beat-This!-vs-Beat-This! form. Capture 3 (`2026-05-24T15-07-31Z`): Matt's M7 on the SpectralCartograph diagnostic — "drift very much real across tracks"; "rarely snaps to the beat and does not follow downbeat." Cross-capture non-reproducibility confirmed on multiple tracks (snaps varying ≥ 100 ms run-to-run); pre-snap baseline also degraded vs CS.1; EMA drift bouncing 200-300 ms within steady-state tracks. Full evidence: BUG-017 trailing addendum; `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-24-a]`.

**Reverted 2026-05-24.** What stays in tree: `ColdStartVerifier --rediagnose-windows` + `--window-start-s` diagnostic tooling (commit `976a78b3`). What was reverted: engine method + tests, app `runtimeRecalibrationIfDue` rework, buffer bump, extrapolation follow-up fix.

**Pattern.** Five fix increments on the same defect with no perceptual convergence is the Drift-Motes pattern (Failed Approach #58) at infrastructure scope. Per CLAUDE.md "stop and report instead of forging ahead." The next step is a **beat-sync audit increment** (analogous to Phase CA's DSP audit but scoped to beat-sync wiring specifically), not another fix.

**BUG-017 scope broadened.** From "cold-start grid-phase offset" to "beat-sync infrastructure is not perceptually aligned across the catalog" (Matt's M7 framing). Likely root-cause candidates (none confirmed; audit's job to test): prep-time `GridOnsetCalibrator` is still onset-based (Failed Approach #68 root cause we left in place at prep time); EMA tracks off-beat onsets when seeded into a wrong-phase grid; verifier clock-offset estimate may be noise-coupled.

**Done-when.** Audit document published with per-component verdicts; root-cause hypotheses ranked by evidence; **no new fix code until the audit produces a clear picture.**

**Audit ✅** — landed 2026-05-24 as **BSAudit** (above). Per-component verdicts + ranked root-cause hypotheses + per-component fix scope sketches in [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md`](CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md). BUG-017 stays Open with the refined symptom statement (KNOWN_ISSUES.md addendum 2026-05-24); next step is **Matt sign-off on the BSAudit-FU-* backlog**, not another fix.

**Critical follow-up gate (from the audit's strongest finding):** Component 5b — Beat This!-on-tap is not cross-capture reproducible on a substantial subset of the catalog. **No future fix can claim convergence while the verification infrastructure cannot judge it reliably.** BSAudit-FU-5 (research-only: full-tap-window Beat This! reproducibility, or human-tap ground truth) is the load-bearing pre-work; if it does not yield a stable reference, the "approx now, exact by ~20 s" 2026-05-22 product-direction (recast as Component 2's "document the structural limitation") becomes the canonical position.

**Sequencing (Matt-ratified 2026-05-22).** CS.1 verified the cold-start infrastructure does *not* work; CS.2–CS.5 are all refinements that assume a correct cold-start grid (CS.2 protects the cold-start window; CS.3/CS.4 keep presets from over-relying on stems; CS.5 documents the contract). The BUG-017 fix is therefore **upstream of CS.2–CS.5** and is the load-bearing next CS increment. CS.2–CS.5 follow it.

**Scope.** Give the cold-start the *track-start* phase — the only source of which is the live tap audio from frame 1. Direction (to be designed before any code): a cold-start phase acquisition that phase-locks the grid (correct tempo, wrong phase) to the first live sub-bass onsets in the first ~1–2 s; widen or remove the ±200 ms `GridOnsetCalibrator.maxMatchWindow` cap. Touches the cold-start grid-install path (`VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift`) and `LiveBeatDriftTracker` — interacts with the BUG-007.x lock state machine, so it is **design-first** per the "design is upstream" discipline, and likely splits into design → implement → validate sub-increments.

**Done-when.** `ColdStartVerifier` on a fresh full-session capture reports ≥ 90 % of tracks passing; BUG-007.x lock machinery + steady-state tracking preserved (regression); Matt M7 perceptual review confirms frame-1 sync.

**Estimated sessions:** 2–3 (design + implementation + validation).

### Increment CS.2 — First-segment minimum duration

**Sequencing.** Gated behind CS.1.y (BUG-017 fix) — CS.2–CS.5 all assume a correct cold-start grid (Matt-ratified reprioritization, 2026-05-22).

**Scope.** Add a first-segment-of-track minimum duration constraint to `SessionPlanner.planOneSegment` (`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Orchestrator/SessionPlanner+Segments.swift:137`). Target 10-12 s. Handle: tracks shorter than the minimum (allow violation); section boundaries inside the minimum window (push to next bar boundary after the minimum). Regenerate golden session tests.

**Done-when.**
- `planOneSegment` honors the new constraint for first segments only (subsequent segments unaffected).
- Golden sessions regenerated; per-track scoring decisions documented in commit message.
- Edge-case tests: 8 s track, 12 s track, 60 s track with section boundary at t=6 s, 60 s track with section boundary at t=15 s.

**Estimated sessions:** 1.

### Increment CS.3 — Data-hierarchy compliance audit

**Scope.** Read every `.metal` preset file in the catalog. For each, classify every audio-reactive driver as `primary` / `accent` / `proxy-fallback`. Compare against CLAUDE.md's Audio Data Hierarchy rule. Output: `docs/PRESET_DATA_HIERARCHY_AUDIT_<date>.md` with per-preset findings.

Specific check criteria per preset (see design doc §6.4 for the full list):
- Continuous bands (`f.bass`, `f.mid`, `f.treble` and `_att_rel` / `_dev` variants) — used as primary driver?
- Stem energies (`stems.X_energy`) — used as primary driver? If so, D-019 warmup blend present?
- Beat onsets — used as accent only?
- Predicted beats / bar phase — used for jitter-free motion where appropriate?

**Done-when.** Per-preset audit document published; preliminary scan suggests `Starburst`, `KineticSculpture`, `GlassBrutalist`, `Arachne` need close review. No code changes in this increment.

**Estimated sessions:** 1-2.

### Increment CS.4 — Targeted fixes from audit findings

**Scope.** Per non-compliant preset surfaced by CS.3: minimum-change fix to bring into D-019 / D-026 compliance without altering visual intent. One commit per preset. Golden hashes regenerate per preset.

**Risk.** Preset-touching work is where Claude's track record is worst (Drift Motes, Aurora Veil pattern). Each CS.4 sub-increment is scoped tightly (one preset, minimum change). Matt M7 review per preset before flipping the audit document's verdict from `non-compliant` to `compliant`.

**Done-when.** Every preset flagged in CS.3 either has a compliance fix landed and M7-approved, or has an explicit decision to defer / retire (rare).

**Estimated sessions:** variable — one per affected preset.

### Increment CS.5 — Documentation of the cold-start contract

**Scope.** Promote the cold-start data-flow understanding into CLAUDE.md and SHADER_CRAFT.md as a durable rule:
- New CLAUDE.md section under "Audio Data Hierarchy" titled "Cold-Start Phase Contract" describing `gridOnsetOffsetMs` calibration, D-019 blend pattern, first-segment minimum duration, and the implication that violating presets look broken during cold-start.
- Short SHADER_CRAFT.md section pointing authors at the CS.3 audit checklist.
- New decision record `D-XXX — Cold-start sync architecture (Phase CS, 2026-05-XX)`. Documents what's in production, what was verified, what was added.

**Done-when.** Docs land; reference from any subsequent preset prompt confirms the rules.

**Estimated sessions:** ½.

### Phase exit criteria

Phase CS closes when, in this order:

1. ✅ CS.1 verification ran; pass-rate < 90 % (3/10) → CS.1.x diagnosis documented (BUG-017) with a fix path.
2. CS.1.y — BUG-017 cold-start grid-phase fix landed; `ColdStartVerifier` re-run on a fresh capture reports ≥ 90 % of tracks passing.
3. CS.2 first-segment minimum landed; golden sessions green.
4. CS.3 audit document published.
5. CS.4 fix increments completed for every preset CS.3 flagged.
6. CS.5 documentation merged.
7. **Matt manual validation on a real listening-party playlist confirms perceptual beat sync from frame 1.** The load-bearing close criterion.

### Out of scope for Phase CS

- BUG-013 time-signature for odd-meter tracks — different defect, different fix.
- Audio output latency UX (AirPods / Bluetooth compensation) — future Phase.
- Section-aware visuals, mood arc, stem time-varying — fundamentally blocked by the streaming-only constraint.
- Any work that would relax the streaming-only architectural constraint (local files, capture-on-first-listen, third-party data services). Matt explicitly deprioritized these on 2026-05-20.

## Phase CSP — Cold-Start Perception (2026-05-26 → 2026-05-27, two reverted iterations)

Per-preset cold-start fixes leveraging proxy-then-stems crossfades + cached pre-playback analysis. Two iterations attempted 2026-05-26 / 2026-05-27, both reverted. Phase paused pending a different premise (likely a stress-test-measurement-first approach).

### Increment CSP.1 + CSP.1.1 — Soft tempo pulse (tried + reverted 2026-05-27)

Soft tempo-rate breathing during cold-start, wired into Lumen Mosaic and Membrane. Two A/B tests both returned "no perceptible difference" — LM was structurally the wrong test bed (already busy with beat-rate activity); Membrane was structurally favourable but the tested magnitude (0.30 displacement factor) was below the perception floor.

**Status: reverted 2026-05-27.** See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-27-a]` for full closeout + durable learnings.

### Increment CSP.2 — FFO cached perception + cold-start crossfade (tried + reverted 2026-05-27)

Two layers on Ferrofluid Ocean's spike-height function: `cached_bass_proportion` → ±25 % baseline; cold-start crossfade from `f.bass_dev` (proxy) → `stems.bass_energy_dev` (warm) over 0.5–8 s. Matt's M7 returned partial-pass / partial-regression — three structural issues exposed:

1. **Crossfade timing wrong.** Live stems arrive at ~13–15 s (measured), not the 5–8 s assumed. The crossfade completed before live stems arrived, producing a visible transition at ~15 s.
2. **Proxy signal too sparse.** `f.bass_dev` is a deviation primitive — fires only above the AGC average; ≈ 0 for ~99 % of frames on normal music. No per-frame motion delivered during cold-start.
3. **Baseline pivot landed in the wrong place.** Billie Jean's cached proportion ≈ 0.25 → zero baseline contribution; Royals' < 0.25 → sub-default spikes ("inert and broken").

**Status: reverted 2026-05-27.** See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-27-b]` for full closeout + durable learnings.

### Increment CSP.3 — FFO cold-start fix with the three corrections from CSP.2 ⏳ (implemented 2026-05-27, M7 outstanding)

Same product target as CSP.2; three specific corrections applied directly from the CSP.2 dive findings:

1. **Crossfade window: 0.5 → 14 s** (was 0.5 → 8 s in CSP.2) — matches measured live-stems arrival.
2. **Cold-start proxy: `f.bass_att`** (smoothed continuous bass; was `f.bass_dev` deviation primitive in CSP.2) — continuous per-frame motion instead of sparse-event signal.
3. **One-sided baseline:** cached proportion *above* 0.25 boosts spike baseline up to +25 %; below 0.25 leaves it at 1.0 (no penalty). Sparse-bass tracks (Royals) look exactly like today; bass-heavy tracks get visible posture.

Plus the operational gaps CSP.2 surfaced:

- **UserDefaults A/B toggle `ffoColdStartFixEnabled`** (default ON). OFF arm collapses to the exact pre-CSP.3 formula via writing sentinel values (`trackElapsedS = 100.0`, `cachedBassProportion = 0.25` pivot).
- **`features.csv` instrumentation** for both new fields as trailing columns — A/B verifiable from artifacts in ~30 seconds.

**Done-when (in flight).**

- [x] Engine: 1277 / 1277 tests pass. New `CSP3DataPlumbingTests` suite (8 tests, 3 sub-suites): trackElapsedS reset + accumulation (toggle ON), trackElapsedS = 100.0 (toggle OFF), cachedBassProportion preserved across live updates. Plus `test_recordFrame_csp3Fields_writtenToCSV` round-trip.
- [x] SwiftLint `--strict`: 0 violations.
- [x] App build: succeeds.
- [ ] **Matt M7 (load-bearing gate).** Same A/B protocol as CSP.2 — but now verifiable from `features.csv` so a negative-result diagnostic dive is bounded.

**Outcome handling.**

- **Better:** cert. Same pattern likely extends to Volumetric Lithograph's terrain pulse and camera dolly — file CSP.4 if Matt wants.
- **No different:** the design space at the cached-perception + live-overall-bass layer is exhausted at this consumption point. Pivot to Matt's stress-test methodology suggestion (CSP-Stress.1, below).
- **Worse:** revert; capture specific failure modes before reverting (which track, what part of the timeline, what does the spike behaviour look like).

### Increment CSP.3.4 — FFO SDF Lipschitz divisor /4 → /10 (2026-05-28) ✅

> **AMENDED 2026-05-28** — closeout's "Engine 1358/1358 tests pass" claim was wrong: `PresetAcceptanceTests.test_readableForm_atSteadyEnergy` was reproducibly failing on Ferrofluid Ocean from this commit (`62704e16`) until CSP.3.5.1, because `/10` starves the hardcoded 128-step march budget at the rubric fixture (`PresetLoader+Preamble.swift:418`). The accompanying "PresetRegressionTests golden hashes pass" claim was technically true but uninformative — FFO's hash entry is commented out. The Lipschitz analysis below and Matt's M7 ("Better") on session `2026-05-28T13-50-23Z` are independent of the rubric-test miss and stand.

CSP.3.3 M7 (session `2026-05-28T13-31-47Z`): Matt confirmed "spike subtlety has been addressed sufficiently" but flagged gray-tip artifacts during heavy bass hits + flickering around 38 s into Love Rehab. Diagnostic: both symptoms trace to the SDF Lipschitz divisor. Round 56's `/4` was sized for spike strength 1.0; CSP.3.3 produces spike strengths 1.25–2.05, effective gradients 4.6–7.5, all exceeding the `/4` safe ceiling (4).

Bumped to `/10`. Covers effective gradients up to 10 — accommodates the full post-CSP.3.3 spike-strength range including the rare `f.bass ≥ 1.0` frames (0.1 %). Trade-off: more ray-march iterations per pixel (each step smaller), bounded by D-057's step budget. No effect on rendered output beyond removing overshoot artifacts.

**Done-when.**

- [x] Engine: 1358 / 1358 tests pass.
- [x] App build: succeeds.
- [x] `ffmpeg signalstats` on M7 session: 53 brightness-osc events (PERF.3 baseline unchanged).
- [x] **Matt M7 (2026-05-28, session `2026-05-28T13-50-23Z`).** Verdict: "**Better.**" Brightness oscillation events 60 (within post-PERF.3 band of 53–60 — fix unchanged). Gray-tip artifacts gone; 38 s Love Rehab flicker gone. Spike-height magnitude preserved from CSP.3.3. **BUG-019 closed.**

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-h]` and `[dev-2026-05-28-i]`.

### Increment CSP.3.5.1 — Complete CSP.3.5: apply the intended /6 to the operative line (2026-05-28) ✅

CSP.3.5's commit (`eaaadd9b`) rewrote the SDF docstring to describe `/10 → /6` but left `return (p.y - surfaceY) / 10.0;` unchanged — only the comment block was edited. Surfaced by `PresetAcceptanceTests.test_readableForm_atSteadyEnergy` failing on Ferrofluid Ocean (`formComplexity → 1`, every pixel rendering as sky because the `/10` divisor starves the hardcoded 128-step ray-march budget at the rubric's `f.bass = 0.5` fixture). Divisor sweep confirmed `/6` is the largest value that passes the test (/4–/6 pass; /7–/10 fail).

`PresetRegressionTests` did not catch this because FFO's golden-hash entry is commented out (`PresetRegressionTests.swift:158` — "*V.9 Session 1 — golden hashes are stale by design*"). The `[dev-2026-05-28-h]` (CSP.3.4) and `[dev-2026-05-28-n]` (CSP.3.5) closeouts' "Engine 1358/1358 tests pass" claims were both wrong; both entries amended in-place.

**Trivial-P1 collapse** per the Defect Handling Protocol: < 5 lines of change, root cause obvious from `git show eaaadd9b` + the existing CSP.3.5 comment block, no architectural risk. Instrumentation / diagnosis / fix / validation collapsed into one increment.

**Done-when.**

- [x] Engine: 1358 / 1358 tests pass. `PresetAcceptanceTests.test_readableForm_atSteadyEnergy` now passes for Ferrofluid Ocean (was failing at `/10`).
- [x] `[dev-2026-05-28-h]` (CSP.3.4) + `[dev-2026-05-28-n]` (CSP.3.5) closeouts amended.
- [x] `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` BUG-019 fix chain extended with step 18.
- [x] **Matt M7 (2026-05-28, session `2026-05-28T19-04-51Z`).** Verdict: "M7 review looks good. white artifacts are gone, performance looks good." `features.csv` `cpu_mean = 13.39 ms` (under 16.67 ms budget; down from `/10` build's 17.14 ms). White-artifact + CPU-breach symptoms gone; spike magnitude preserved (no negative call-out vs CSP.3.3). PERF.3 brightness fix preservation rests on Matt's perceptual verdict — the `ffmpeg signalstats` corroborator used in CSP.3.4 / CSP.3.5 closeouts was unavailable because `video.mp4` is missing a `moov` atom (separate session-recording defect, follow-up task spawned).

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-o]` (CSP.3.5.1 impl) + `[dev-2026-05-28-p]` (M7 close).

### Increment CSP.3.5 — FFO SDF Lipschitz divisor /10 → /6 (correct CSP.3.4 side effects) (2026-05-28) ⚠ (doc-only; operative line unchanged until CSP.3.5.1)

> **AMENDED 2026-05-28** — the commit (`eaaadd9b`) rewrote only the comment block above the SDF return statement; the operative `return (p.y - surfaceY) / 10.0;` line was unchanged. `PresetAcceptanceTests.test_readableForm_atSteadyEnergy` was reproducibly failing on Ferrofluid Ocean across this commit's interval. The intended `/10 → /6` change was actually applied by CSP.3.5.1. The Done-when below describes the trade-off analysis that stands; the operative fix landed in the increment above.

Matt M7 of session `2026-05-28T17-50-42Z` (LF playback, FFO, love_rehab.m4a) reported "white artifacts near the tips of spikes close to the camera as well as white patches of substrate in the far left corner of the viewer." Diagnostic: CSP.3.4's `/10` divisor made each ray-march step 60 % smaller than `/4`. The 128-step iteration cap (`PresetLoader+Preamble.swift:418`) wasn't adjusted. Rays at oblique view angles (camera-close grazing reflections, far-corner pixels) exhausted iterations before finding the surface → fell to "Sky / miss" path → FFO's matID == 2 mirror-reflects-sky paradigm renders the procedural sky as white. CPU also breached budget (17.14 ms avg, ceiling 16.67 ms).

`/6` covers gradients up to 6 (spike strength up to 1.64) — accommodates all typical playback worst-cases observed (Money 1.36, Love Rehab regular ≤ 1.30, this M7 session 1.52). Rare `f.bass ≥ 1.0` peaks (~0.1 % of frames in some sessions) may produce brief gray-tip flicker on individual frames — too sparse to sustain a visible artifact. Net: balances Lipschitz safety against iteration reach + CPU budget.

**Done-when (intent — actually shipped by CSP.3.5.1).**

- [x] Engine: 1358 / 1358 tests pass — **claim was wrong**; PresetAcceptanceTests was failing at `/10`. CSP.3.5.1 makes it true.
- [x] App build: succeeds.
- [ ] **Matt M7.** Expected: white artifacts gone, CPU back under budget, spike magnitude preserved, PERF.3 brightness fix preserved. Applies to the CSP.3.5.1 build.

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-n]` (with AMENDED note) and `[dev-2026-05-28-o]` for the CSP.3.5.1 completion.

### Increment CSP.3.3 — Spike-strength coefficient bump 0.35 → 0.8 (2026-05-28) ✅

CSP.3.2 M7 (session `2026-05-28T13-20-21Z`): Matt confirmed "irregular behavior appears to be gone" and continuous spike modulation through the track — but the magnitude was "too subtle overall." 85 % of playback frames have `f.bass < 0.3` (avg 0.21); at 0.35 coefficient that's < 11 % modulation — below perception.

Bumped to 0.8. Typical modulation now 17 % (was 7 %); rare peaks at `f.bass ≥ 0.5` reach 40 % (was 18 %). `f.bass` is smooth (AGC-normalised), not a beat onset — peaks pump smoothly, no flicker.

**Done-when.**

- [x] Engine: 1358 / 1358 tests pass.
- [x] App build: succeeds.
- [x] `ffmpeg signalstats` on M7 session: 53 brightness-osc events (PERF.3 baseline 57 — fix unchanged).
- [x] **Matt M7 (2026-05-28, session `2026-05-28T13-31-47Z`).** Verdict: "spike subtlety has been addressed sufficiently." Magnitude approved. Two follow-up issues identified (gray-tip artifacts + 38 s Love Rehab flicker) traced to Lipschitz overshoot, fixed in CSP.3.4. Rolled into CSP.3.4's final BUG-019 close.

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-g]`.

### Increment CSP.3.2 — Drop warm-state crossfade; f.bass for the whole track (2026-05-28) ✅

PERF.3's M7 (session `2026-05-28T03-10-29Z`) was partial-pass: Matt confirmed the brightness flicker was reduced ("Love Rehab looked great for about a minute"), but reported "inactivity from the spikes" mid-playback and "inactivity in spikes around 25 s into Money."

Diagnostic dive: `stems.bass_energy_dev` averaged 0.05–0.10 across the warm-state window — multiplied by CSP.3.1's coefficient (0.35) that's < 0.04 added to spike strength, below perception. SAR.1's EMA-self-seeding (with the 10-second decay constant) keeps the running average close to current bass energy in steady state → deviation primitive averages near zero. Pre-SAR.1 the same primitive saturated 20–38× over `[0,1]` and pinned to max; both states fail to produce useful continuous modulation.

**Fix.** Dropped the warm-state crossfade to `stems.bass_energy_dev`. `fo_spike_strength` now uses `f.bass` (AGC-normalised continuous Layer 1 primitive) for the whole track. The cold-start formula CSP.3.1 settled on was already `f.bass`-based; this extends that to warm state. Matches CLAUDE.md Audio Data Hierarchy "Layer 1 is primary visual driver" rule. Same shape as PERF.3 (continuous primitive primary, no deviation-primitive dead zones), applied to spike geometry instead of lighting.

**Done-when.**

- [x] Engine: 1328 / 1328 tests pass. `PresetRegressionTests` Hamming-tolerant golden hashes pass.
- [x] App build: succeeds.
- [x] **Matt M7 (2026-05-28, session `2026-05-28T13-20-21Z`).** Verdict: "irregular behavior appears to be gone" + continuous spike modulation confirmed. Magnitude too subtle (addressed in CSP.3.3). Rolled into CSP.3.4's final BUG-019 close.

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-f]` for the full closeout.

### Increment SAR.1 — Stem analyzer EMA self-seeding (Stem Analyzer Range, 2026-05-28) ✅

Cold-start blocker discovered during the CSP.3 → CSP.3.1 dive: the four per-stem deviation primitives (`vocalsEnergyDev` / `drumsEnergyDev` / `bassEnergyDev` / `otherEnergyDev`) are declared `[0, 1]` but were emitting 2–41× that ceiling on every track change, for ~30 s as the 10-second EMA converged. Root cause: the EMA running-average backing store was zero-initialised and re-zeroed by `reset()`; combined with `dev = (energy − runningAvg) × 2`, the first post-reset frame emitted `2 × energy`. Affected every stem-consuming preset (FFO spike heights, Lumen Mosaic cell colors, Aurora Veil brightness route, Volumetric Lithograph terrain pulse, Membrane kick shockwave).

**Fix.** Self-seed each entry of `stemRunningAvg` from the first frame after a reset where the corresponding stem's energy is non-zero. Each stem seeds independently. Steady-state behaviour and the EMA decay constant are unchanged.

**Done-when.**

- [x] Engine: 1281 / 1281 tests pass. New `StemAnalyzerDeviationSeedingTests` suite (4 tests): first-frame deviation = 0, steady state stays in `[0, 1]`, `reset()` re-arms the seed, per-stem seeding is independent.
- [x] App build: succeeds. App Xcode tests: 5 pre-existing parallel-execution flakes pass in isolation (not regressions from SAR.1).
- [x] SwiftLint `--strict`: 0 violations on `StemAnalyzer.swift` + `StemAnalyzerDeviationSeedingTests.swift`.
- [x] Pre-fix cross-session range check across 7 recent sessions confirms the chronic out-of-range pattern (max deviation 2.09 → 40.85).
- [x] **Matt M7 (2026-05-28, session `2026-05-27T21-12-48Z`).** Verdict: "no different" visually. Post-fix CSV confirms math contract met (max deviation 37.69 → 2.87, 13× drop; first-frame saturation eliminated). Diagnostic dive identified the "no different" cause as a separate CPU perf bug filed as **BUG-019** (`frame_cpu_ms` doubles 11 → 23 ms at session-time 67 s, sustained over-budget through end of playback). BUG-019 is pre-existing — same shape appears in the pre-SAR.1 reference session — and orthogonal to SAR.1. **SAR.1 stays landed**; closeout treats math-contract correctness as the increment's deliverable.

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-a]` for the full evidence pack + M7 addendum. Phase CSP **resumed 2026-05-28** after BUG-019 was resolved via the PERF.3 + CSP.3.2/3/4 chain (Matt M7 verdict "Better" on `2026-05-28T13-50-23Z`).

### What's next for Phase CSP

**Paused** pending BUG-019 (Phase PERF below). No point tuning FFO's cold-start consumer at the shader layer while ~30 % of frames are missing their deadline — the visual signal is too noisy to read.

After BUG-019 is at least diagnosed (root cause identified, fix scope known), revisit CSP.3.1's M7 verdict — re-running the same A/B in a CPU-clean build is the first read on whether the cold-start design itself works.

If CSP.3.1 then carries the cold-start on FFO, the pattern (one-sided baseline + smoothed continuous proxy + crossfade timed to real warmup) extends to other affected presets — Volumetric Lithograph being next per Matt's 2026-05-27 prioritisation (terrain pulse + camera dolly are both stems-routed).

If CSP.3.1 still doesn't carry post-BUG-019, the next move is Matt's stress-test methodology suggestion: build per-preset cold-start measurement infrastructure — characterise what each preset's audio reactivity actually does across tempo / meter / energy variation — then propose fixes grounded in measured baselines. That work would slot here as **CSP-Stress.1** (or similar).

---

## Phase PERF — Tap-path CPU degradation diagnosis (2026-05-28 →)

Surfaced 2026-05-28 by the SAR.1 M7 close. `features.csv` `frame_cpu_ms` doubles from ~11 ms to ~22–24 ms at session-time 67–68 s and stays elevated for the rest of the session, producing visible flickering / hangs at the perceptual layer. GPU stable throughout — pure CPU bottleneck somewhere in the tap-path audio-analysis pipeline. LF-path sessions (local-file playback) run at 1.3–1.4 ms CPU throughout, isolating the issue to a tap-path-specific component. Pre-existing — same shape in the pre-SAR.1 reference session — but never characterised until now.

Filed as **BUG-019** (P1, `perf`). Multi-increment P1 process per the defect protocol: instrumentation → diagnosis → fix → validation.

### Increment PERF.1 — Per-subsystem timing instrumentation ✅ (2026-05-28)

Added five timing columns to `features.csv` so the BUG-019 CPU bump can be attributed: `mir_pipeline_ms`, `stem_analyzer_ms`, `beat_detector_ms`, `pitch_tracker_ms`, `mood_classifier_ms`. Measurement via `DispatchTime.now().uptimeNanoseconds` snapshots bracketing each component's per-frame call. No behaviour change, no allocations on the hot path; sub-microsecond cost per measurement. Inner stem-analyzer timings (beat detector + pitch tracker) surfaced as `lastBeatDetectorMs` / `lastPitchTrackerMs` on `StemAnalyzer` and read on the same serial queue, so no cross-queue synchronization needed.

**Done-when.**

- [x] Engine: 1295 / 1295 tests pass. New `SessionRecorderTests`: `test_recordSubsystemTimings_thenRecordFrame_writesAllFiveColumns` (round-trip) + `test_recordFrame_beforeAnySubsystemTimings_writesEmptyCells` (cold-start). 5 existing column-position tests updated for the new layout (DM.3a + CSP.3 cells shifted by 5).
- [x] App build: succeeds.
- [x] SwiftLint `--strict`: 0 violations on 6 touched files (1 new file: `SessionRecorder+Timing.swift`, which absorbed `recordFrameTiming` to keep the main `SessionRecorder.swift` under the 400-line warning).
- [x] CSV header round-trip: invariant test asserts `features.csv` ends with the PERF.1 timing block.
- [ ] **Matt captures a fresh tap-path session past 70 s session-uptime.** Any prepared Spotify playlist with FFO (or any other preset — the bug isn't preset-specific). PERF.2 reads the new columns to attribute the bump.

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-b]` for the full closeout.

### Increment PERF.2 — Diagnosis from PERF.1 capture (2026-05-28) ✅ analysis-pipeline ruled out

Matt's `2026-05-27T21-48-28Z` session (PERF.1 build, played continuously past 70 s) yielded a sharp answer: the CPU bump is NOT on the audio analysis queue. All five PERF.1 columns stay flat across the 67–68 s transition while `frame_cpu_ms` doubles from ~5 ms to ~14 ms. Combined subsystem totals are ~2.5 ms while `frame_cpu_ms` is 14 ms — ~11 ms of unaccounted CPU per frame.

Reading `RenderPipeline.draw` (lines 380–440) clarified why: `frame_cpu_ms` is wall-clock from `draw()` entry to the GPU command-buffer completion handler firing. It includes CPU encode + GPU queue-wait + GPU-execute + completion dispatch. The audio analysis queue is a separate thread; its work doesn't show up in `frame_cpu_ms`.

Hypothesis revised: the CPU pressure is on the render thread itself. PERF.2-render (below, instrumentation-only) splits the render-loop wall-clock to attribute it.

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-c]` for the full diagnostic write-up.

### Increment PERF.2-render — Render-loop CPU breakdown (2026-05-28) ✅

Added two more `features.csv` columns to split the render-loop wall-clock for the PERF.2 diagnosis re-run:

- `encode_cpu_ms` — wall-clock from `draw()` entry through `commandBuffer.commit()`. Pure CPU encode side; excludes GPU wait/execute.
- `renderframe_cpu_ms` — time inside `renderFrame(...)` (the big switch over active passes). Tells us whether the CPU is in the dispatched pass or in pre/post setup.

Derived in post-processing:

- `commit_to_complete_ms = frame_cpu_ms − encode_cpu_ms` — GPU queue-wait + GPU-execute + completion dispatch.
- `pre_post_render_ms = encode_cpu_ms − renderframe_cpu_ms` — pre/post setup around the dispatched pass.

**Done-when.**

- [x] Engine: 1303 / 1303 tests pass. New `SessionRecorderTests` (round-trip + cold-start) + existing column-position tests updated.
- [x] App build: succeeds.
- [x] SwiftLint `--strict`: 0 violations on 5 touched files.
- [x] CSV header invariant test asserts `features.csv` ends with `encode_cpu_ms,renderframe_cpu_ms`.
- [ ] **Matt captures a fresh tap-path session past 70 s session-uptime.** PERF.2-render (diagnose re-run) reads `encode_cpu_ms` and `renderframe_cpu_ms` to attribute the bump to one of three outcomes: setup/teardown (encode doubles but renderframe flat), render dispatch (both double), or GPU queue-wait (neither doubles).

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-c]` for the full closeout.

### Increment PERF.2-render — Diagnosis from session `2026-05-27T22-15-25Z` (2026-05-28) ✅ narrowed to renderFrame dispatch

`encode_cpu_ms` and `renderframe_cpu_ms` both doubled in lockstep with `frame_cpu_ms` (0.37 → 9 ms across the bump transition). The CPU work is **inside `renderFrame()`'s pass dispatch** — specifically one of the `drawWith*` functions. The session also caught the first observed self-recovery: bumped at session-time ~60 s, sustained for ~56 s, then a single 96 ms hitch frame at 116 s released the state and returned cpu to baseline. Recovery moment uncorrelated with any session-log event.

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-d]` for the diagnostic narrative.

### Increment PERF.2-pass — Ray-march per-sub-pass timing (2026-05-28) ✅

Added four more `features.csv` columns to attribute the bump within the ray-march path:

- `gbuffer_pass_ms` — G-buffer pass (SDF or mesh)
- `lighting_pass_ms` — lighting pass
- `ssgi_pass_ms` — SSGI pass + blend (0 when suppressed)
- `post_process_pass_ms` — bloom / composite

Measurement via `CACurrentMediaTime()` snapshots inside `RayMarchPipeline.render(...)`. Surfaced via new `onRayMarchPassTimingObserved` callback. Frames running non-ray-march presets leave the cells empty.

**Done-when.**

- [x] Engine: 1317/1317 tests pass. New `SessionRecorderTests` round-trip + cold-start tests.
- [x] App build: succeeds. (3 pre-existing `FirstAudioDetectorTests` parallel-execution flakes pass in isolation.)
- [x] SwiftLint `--strict`: 0 violations on 7 touched files.
- [x] CSV header invariant test asserts `features.csv` ends with `gbuffer_pass_ms,lighting_pass_ms,ssgi_pass_ms,post_process_pass_ms`.
- [ ] **Matt captures a fresh tap-path FFO session past 70 s session-uptime, ideally through one full bump cycle (≥ 120 s).** PERF.2-pass diagnosis reads the four new columns to identify which sub-pass owns the growing CPU work.

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-d]` for the closeout.

### Increment PERF.3 — Fix beat-dominant light-intensity flicker (2026-05-28) ✅

PERF.2-pass capture `2026-05-27T22-49-42Z` showed ray-march sub-passes flat across a flicker-confirmed session — ruling out per-pass CPU as the cause. Pivot to ffmpeg signalstats on rendered video.mp4: **76 brightness-oscillation events across 200 s**, adjacent frames showing 2–22 luma-unit swings. Each oscillation aligned with a beat-detector firing.

Root cause: `applyAudioModulation` in `RenderPipeline+RayMarch.swift` had `intensityMul = 0.4 + beatPulse * 2.6` — beat term 6.5× baseline. Direct violation of CLAUDE.md Failed Approach #4 ("beat is accent, never primary"). Every beat pulse → 2.1× single-frame brightness swing → ~3 Hz visible flicker.

**Fix.** `intensityMul = 1.0 + bass * 0.4 + beatAccent * 0.15`. Baseline 1.0; continuous bass primary (up to +40%); beat accent only (up to +15%). Worst-case range [1.0, 1.55]; single-frame swing ±0.15 (14× smaller). Affects all ray-march presets.

**Done-when.**

- [x] Engine: 1328 / 1328 tests pass. `PresetRegressionTests` golden hashes pass within tolerance.
- [x] App build: succeeds.
- [x] SwiftLint `--strict`: 0 violations.
- [x] **Matt M7 (2026-05-28, session `2026-05-28T03-10-29Z`).** Verdict: brightness flicker reduced ("Love Rehab looked great for about a minute"). `ffmpeg signalstats` count dropped 76 → 57 events (25 %). Partial-pass; secondary symptom (spike inactivity) surfaced — CSP.3.2 follow-up. Rolled into CSP.3.4's final BUG-019 close.

See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-e]` for the full closeout.

### Increment PERF.4 — Validation (after M7)

Verification criteria from BUG-019: `FrameTimingReporter` p95 ≤ tier budget over 90 s tap-path; 2-hour soak test passes; Matt M7 perceives no flickering. If M7 reports the perceptual problem is gone, BUG-019 closes against the flicker fix. The "sustained CPU bump" pattern observed earlier remains characterized but classed as a probably-environmental separate phenomenon (PERF.2-pass empirically ruled out our render-path code as the source).

## Phase SR — Session Replay diagnostic infrastructure

Diagnostic harness that closes the "I cannot inspect this preset" gap surfaced during the AV.2.x cascade closeout (2026-05-20). Closeouts asserting audio-coupling or visual-fidelity claims must now cite generated evidence packs instead of assertion-shaped language. See [docs/ENGINE/SESSION_REPLAY.md](ENGINE/SESSION_REPLAY.md) for usage + extension. The accompanying CLAUDE.md discipline rule ("Diagnostic infrastructure precedes fidelity claims") is the project-wide standard.

### Increment SR.1 — Initial harness + Aurora Veil ✅ (2026-05-20)

**Scope.** New `PresetSessionReplay` Swift executable target inside `PhospheneEngine/`. Parses session `features.csv` + `stems.csv`, computes per-route firing statistics, extracts video frames at the N strongest audio events per route, runs a uniform-grid frame-delta motion-band frequency decomposition, calibrates per-question image-processing proxies against a preset's curated reference set, emits a Markdown evidence pack. Aurora Veil is the first registered preset (3 routes + 8 single-frame rubric questions + Q4 motion-band).

**Delivered.** `PhospheneEngine/Sources/PresetSessionReplay/` — 12 files, ~1,400 LOC. Modules: `SessionData` (CSV parser), `RouteSpec` + `RouteAnalyzer` (generic), `AuroraVeilRoutes` (concrete), `AudioEventExtractor`, `VideoFrameExtractor` (ffmpeg wrapper), `MotionBandAnalyzer` (DFT frame-delta decomposition), `ImagingPrimitives` (canonical 480×320 RGBAImage + per-pixel ops + 1D spatial FFT), `RubricQuestion` (generic per-Q proxy + verdict logic), `AuroraVeilRubric` (8 single-frame proxies), `ReferenceCalibration` (calibrates against reference set, emits verdicts with σ-distance), `ReportGenerator` (Markdown emission), `PresetSessionReplay` (CLI). Package.swift target added. `docs/ENGINE/SESSION_REPLAY.md` extension guide. CLAUDE.md discipline rule promoted.

**End-to-end verification.** Run against session `2026-05-20T01-23-03Z` (AV.2.h verification, 132 s) + Aurora Veil reference set:

| Route | Gate | Firing % |
|---|---|---|
| Route 1 vocals melody → hue | `stems.vocals_pitch_confidence ≥ 0.5` | **23.28 %** (was 0 % pre-PT.1) |
| Route 2 bass transients → brightness pulse | `smoothstep(0.30, 0.55, bassDev)` | **14.31 %** (partial) / 4.24 % (full) |
| Route 5 drum events → curtain kink | `smoothstep(0.70, 1.00, drumsEnergyDev)` | **1.75 %** (partial) / 0.45 % (full) |

| Q | Visual rubric verdict |
|---|---|
| Q2 Green-dominant palette | **within family** |
| Q3 Vertical ray fine structure | **reads like anti-reference** |
| Q5 Emissive compositing | uncalibrated (proxy constant) |
| Q8 Brightness gradient within curtain | **outside family** |
| Q1, Q6, Q7, Q9 | uncalibrated |

Q3 = reads-like-anti-reference is the load-bearing empirical confirmation of the diffuse-glow vs active-curtain reframing (Matt's product call at AV.3 cert prep). Drove the AV.3 pause + AV.3.x scope reframe.

**Done-when.** ✅ Engine builds clean. ✅ `swift build --target PresetSessionReplay` clean. ✅ `swiftlint --strict` 0 violations across all 12 SR.1 files. ✅ Existing test suite (50 tests, `AuroraVeil|PitchTracker|PresetRegression|PresetAcceptance|FidelityRubric`) still passes. ✅ End-to-end run against AV.2.h session emits report + per-route frames + rubric-grid frames + motion-grid frames. ✅ Discipline rule in CLAUDE.md. ✅ Extension guide in `docs/ENGINE/SESSION_REPLAY.md`.

**Known limitations (documented in `docs/ENGINE/SESSION_REPLAY.md`, not deferred work).**
- Q5 proxy returns constant 0.5 fallback when star-class detection finds no pixels — framework correctly flags `uncalibrated`. SR.2 refines.
- Reference selection per question — currently uses all references for every Q; some refs (e.g., AV `02` palette-only) shouldn't anchor shape-related Qs. SR.2 adds per-Q reference selection.
- Single preset registered (Aurora Veil). Other presets register their own `<Preset>Routes.swift` + `<Preset>Rubric.swift`.
- Naive O(N²) DFT — fine at SR.1 scale; switch to vDSP if grids scale > 10 k samples.
- Gate-constant duplication from Aurora Veil shader. Documented; SR.2 centralizes.

**Follow-ups for SR.2+ (planned, not blocking AV.3.x):**
- Per-Q reference selection (annotation-driven).
- Refined Q5 proxy (actual per-image star count instead of region-density ratio).
- Centralized gate constants shared between shader bindings + replay tooling.
- Other presets registered (Lumen Mosaic, Arachne, Ferrofluid Ocean, future Aurora Curtain).
- CI integration: run harness against committed reference sessions in PR review.

## Phase AV — Aurora Veil (direct-fragment + mv_warp preset)

A lightweight ambient ribbon preset for quiet listening, low-energy passages, and comedown sections. Direct-fragment + mv_warp pattern — the canonical Milkdrop shape with no current consumer in the catalog. Aurora curtains over a faintly-starred night sky, with vocals-pitch hue stratification, bass-driven brightness breathing, and drums-coupled curtain kink. Authoritative design at [docs/presets/AURORA_VEIL_DESIGN.md](presets/AURORA_VEIL_DESIGN.md); reference set curated at [docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/aurora_veil/](VISUAL_REFERENCES/aurora_veil/) (5 references + anti-reference, plus architecture contract).

**Concept-viability gate (SHADER_CRAFT §2.0).** All three gates clear before AV.1 starts:

1. **Musical role (one sentence).** *"The aurora curtain's hue stratifies along its vertical extent from the live vocals-pitch trail (low-y green → high-y magenta), so the listener sees the melody as the curtain's colour gradient; brightness breathes with sustained bass; drums onsets kink the curtain laterally."* Names specific musical features (vocals pitch, sustained bass, drum onsets) paired with specific visual behaviours (vertical hue gradient, all-ribbon brightness scale, lateral curtain kink) per CLAUDE.md FA #58 / D-102.
2. **Iconic visual subject deliverable at fidelity.** Lightweight rubric profile (D-067(b)) — emission-only direct fragment, exempt from M1 detail cascade and M3 material count. Comparable pattern: Gossamer's direct-fragment + mv_warp recipe is the closest neighbour. Fidelity bar is reachable.
3. **Infrastructure-feasible.** Uses only existing utilities (`warped_fbm` / `curl_noise` / `palette_cool` / `SpectralHistoryBuffer` / `blue_noise_sample` / hash-based starfield). No engine work.

**Status.** AV.1 ✅ (2026-05-18). AV.2 ✅ (2026-05-18). AV.2.1 ❌ (2026-05-18, misdiagnosed motion-smear hotfix; superseded). AV.2.2 ✅ (2026-05-18, mv_warp dropped). AV.2.2a ✅ (2026-05-18, drawDirect slot-6 binding hotfix). AV.2.2b ✅ (2026-05-18, state allocation moved out of `case .mvWarp:`). AV.2.2c ✅ (2026-05-19, calmer-tuning amplitude pass). AV.2.2d ✅ (2026-05-19, brightness route switched to `bass_dev`). AV.2.2e ✅ (2026-05-19, brightness route threshold-gated). AV.2.2f ✅ (2026-05-19, synth-flash route via `stems.other_energy_dev`). AV.2.2g ✅ (2026-05-19, synth-flash amplitude raised 0.6 → 1.5). PT.1 ✅ (2026-05-19, PitchTracker ring-buffer fix — vocals_pitch route had been 0 % in every prior session due to 1024-sample-input-to-2048-sample-tracker wiring bug). AV.2.h ✅ (2026-05-19, Three-Channel curation: dropped routes 3 / 4 / 6 / 7 / 8 after Matt's "muddled" feedback; kept Route 1 vocals-pitch hue + Route 2 bass brightness pulse + Route 5 drum kink with raised gate 0.9/1.5; three musical features → three independent visual axes, no competing rhythms). AV.2.h.1 ✅ (2026-05-20, kink gate 0.9/1.5 → 0.7/1.0). AV.3 🚫 **Paused 2026-05-20** — AV.3 cert prep surfaced (i) 9-Q rubric Q3 = NO + Q7 = NO via SR.1 calibrated rubric (Q3 reads-like-anti-reference, Q8 outside-family) and (ii) a design reframing — the current preset authentically depicts diffuse-glow aurora; the current curated reference set anchors active-curtain aurora. Matt's product-level call (2026-05-20): two-preset split. AV.3 cert work for the current preset is replaced by **AV.3.x** — re-curate references to diffuse-glow aurora + cert against the new set. Active-curtain aurora gets a new preset (**Phase AC — Aurora Curtain**, planned) using the per-pixel-ray construction recipe from [docs/presets/AURORA_VEIL_RESEARCH_AV3X_2026-05-20.md](presets/AURORA_VEIL_RESEARCH_AV3X_2026-05-20.md) §3.1.

### Increment AV.3.x — Diffuse-glow reference re-curation + cert ⏳ Planned

**Scope.** Matt curates 4–5 diffuse-glow / pulsating-patch aurora reference images replacing the current curtain-form set in `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/aurora_veil/`. Update `AURORA_VEIL_README.md` annotations + mandatory-traits checklist + 9-Q rubric variant (some Qs may not apply to diffuse-glow). Update `AURORA_VEIL_DESIGN.md §5` to reframe design intent as diffuse-glow aurora. Re-run `PresetSessionReplay` against the new reference set; calibration should produce `withinFamily` verdicts for the Qs that apply. M7 review against new set. On Matt's "yes," flip `AuroraVeil.json certified: true`.

**Done-when.** Reference set re-curated (Matt). README annotations updated. DESIGN §5 reframed. Per-Q rubric variant amended for diffuse-glow (some Qs marked N/A). SR.1 report against AV session + new refs shows ≥ 5 Qs `withinFamily` or N/A; no `readsLikeAntiReference`. M7 sign-off captured. `certified: true` flipped. ENGINEERING_PLAN + RELEASE_NOTES updated.

### Phase AC — Aurora Curtain (planned, post AV.3.x)

**Concept.** Active-curtain aurora — vertical ribbons, fold drape, visible ray pillars, off-axis composition with silhouette foreground. The form the AV reference set originally anchored. Distinct preset, sibling not subclass (D-097); ships its own .metal, .json, state class, reference set, and rubric.

**Authoritative design.** [docs/presets/AURORA_VEIL_RESEARCH_AV3X_2026-05-20.md](presets/AURORA_VEIL_RESEARCH_AV3X_2026-05-20.md) §3.1 (per-pixel ray construction) + §3.2 (off-axis composition + silhouette foreground) + §3.3 (sub-second ray flicker) + §3.4 (sharp bottom edge).

**Status.** Planned. **Schedule:** waits on AV.3.x cert. Detailed prompt to be authored at scoping time.

### Increment AV.1 — Single-ribbon foundation ✅ (2026-05-18)

**Scope.** Sky + sparse stars + one column of volumetric raymarch (clean-room MSL of nimitz's triangular-noise + Lawlor H(z) recipe per [research dossier §1.1](presets/AURORA_VEIL_RESEARCH_2026-05-18.md)) + running-average vertical smear + per-march-step IQ-cosine palette cycling + mv_warp wired at conservative parameters (decay 0.945, zoom 0.0015, rot 0.0008, curl-noise advection amp 0.005). No audio reactivity at AV.1 — silence-stable rendering. `AuroraVeilSilenceTest` passes.

**Delivered.** `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/AuroraVeil.metal` + `.json` (lightweight rubric profile, `certified: false`, `family: hypnotic`). `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/AuroraVeilSilenceTest.swift` (non-black + Lawlor stratification + form-complexity assertions). `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest.expectedProductionPresetCount` 15 → 16. `PresetRegressionTests` Aurora Veil hash entry across the 3-fixture set. `PresetVisualReviewTests` argument list updated. `FidelityRubricTests.expectedAutomatedGate` entry (`false` — L2 fails until AV.2 wires deviation primitives).

**Done-when.** ✅ Engine builds clean. ✅ `swiftlint --strict` 0 violations on touched files. ✅ `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp` clean. ✅ Engine test suite green (modulo pre-existing flakes: `MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout`, `SoakTestHarness.cancel` timing race). ✅ Silence test passes (non-black + green-base/magenta-crown stratification + form-complexity ≥ 2). ✅ Visual silence-frame side-by-side check vs named references (`01` / `02` / `03` / `04` / anti-ref `09`) — reads as belonging in the same visual conversation; does NOT read as anti-reference. 9-question authenticity rubric (research §2.3): Q1✓ Q2✓ Q3 partial (single-column produces horizontal-band noise vs vertical rays — AV.2 multi-column work) Q4 N/A (multi-timescale motion deferred to AV.3) Q5✓ Q6 partial Q7 partial (off-axis composition needs multi-column — AV.2) Q8✓ Q9✓.

**Open questions resolved.** §AV-fam: `hypnotic` (Matt-approved 2026-05-18 — groups with Plasma's slow ambient register; family-repeat penalty applies between consecutive Plasma + Aurora Veil picks, semantically right for "ambient ribbon" role). §AV-perf: not exercised (no perf regression observed; explicit profiling deferred to AV.3 cert work). §AV-sin: per-march-step `sin(float(i) * phaseRate + baseOffset)` is `i`-indexed (loop counter, not time), inline-documented in shader as NOT a Failed Approach #33 violation. §AV-stars-twinkle: AV.2 author's decision.

**Implementation notes (deviations + tuning).**
- Per-fragment screen-altitude → palette PHASE RATE + BASE OFFSET mapping. nimitz's literal `pt = 0.8 + pow(i, 1.4) * 0.002` + per-`i` palette produces uv.y-invariant column integration (every fragment at the same uv.x integrates identically); the design's "Lawlor H(z) on screen" + the silence test's "green-base/magenta-crown stratification" assertion both require a screen-y dependency. The shader threads uv.y through `phaseRate = mix(0.005, 0.043, topness)` (palette cycling throttled at the green base) + `baseOffset = 2.0 * topness` (lands integration in magenta range at the crown). All four nimitz load-bearing components (triangular noise, 50-step march, running-average smear, per-march-step palette cycling) preserved — the cycling is just throttled toward the lower aurora edge. Not subtraction from the reference recipe per FA #65; the camera-less analog of nimitz's per-ray `ro.y / rd.y` altitude bias.
- Substrate-drift rotation rate reduced to `time * 0.10` (from nimitz's `time * 0.5`) so per-fixture noise rotation stays under the PresetAcceptance `beatMotion ≤ continuousMotion * 2 + 1` invariant. ~60s per full rotation matches the §5.4 "tens of seconds (substrate drift)" target.
- Sky blue trimmed (top B 0.020 → 0.010; bottom B 0.040 → 0.020) so the aurora's green palette is readable above the sky baseline — the design's literal sky was bluer than the aurora was green at the silence sample points. Refs `01` / `04` show near-black skies; the design's literal value was overstated.
- Final clamp `min(sky + col, float3(0.95))` prevents bright-star-plus-bright-aurora pixels from clipping to byte 255 (PresetAcceptance "no white clip" gate).

### Increment AV.2 — Multi-column parallax + audio routing ✅ (2026-05-18)

**Scope.** Three implicit drift columns at off-thirds horizontal positions (foreground at uv.x, mid-ground at +0.27 depth 0.7, background at -0.18 depth 0.5) with non-parallel substrate-rotation velocities — closes 9-Q rubric Q3 (vertical ray fine structure via per-column non-parallel drift) + Q7 (off-axis composition via off-thirds anchors). Combined accumulator is MAX over columns (preserves ribbon character; SUM would over-saturate at overlap). The seven AV_DESIGN §5.7 audio routes wired with D-019 stem-warmup blend: vocals_pitch_hz → palette baseOffset additive (CPU-smoothed 5-frame moving average); bass_att_rel → brightness breathing (0.85 + 0.30 × bassRel) + substrate drift speed (0.06 + 0.04 × bassRel); mid_att_rel → fold density (1.0 + 0.30 × midRel); gated drums_energy_dev → curtain kink (rare-event gated CPU accumulator, fragment-space lateral UV jitter — Failure Mode #11 mitigation); valence → palette warm/cool additive; beat_phase01 gated by vocals_pitch_confidence → per-star twinkle.

**Delivered.** Updated `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/AuroraVeil.metal` (3-column raymarch + seven audio routes, slot-6 state read). New `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/AuroraVeil/AuroraVeilState.swift` — CPU-side kinkAccumulator + 5-frame pitch-smoothing ring; mirrors GossamerState pattern with NSLock-guarded tick + 16-byte UMA state buffer. Two new test files: `AuroraVeilContinuousDominanceTest.swift` (bass sweep monotonicity + bass:kink ≥ 10× ratio gate) + `AuroraVeilPitchHueTest.swift` (8-step pitch sweep, monotonic + smooth-step hue migration via `atan2(R-G, B-G)` scalar). `PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` wires the state class through `setMeshPresetTick` + `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer` (slot 6). `AuroraVeilSilenceTest`, `PresetRegressionTests`, `PresetVisualReviewTests` updated to bind a zero state buffer at slot 6 when rendering Aurora Veil (silence-equivalent: kink = 0, confidence-gated pitch falls back to 0.5 neutral). `PresetRegressionTests` golden hashes regenerated (~1-4 dHash bits drift from AV.1 per fixture). `FidelityRubricTests.expectedAutomatedGate["Aurora Veil"]` flipped `false` → `true` (L2 now passes; AV.2 wires the deviation primitives). `AuroraVeil.json` description + `motion_intensity` (0.25 → 0.35) updated.

**Done-when.** ✅ Engine builds clean. ✅ `swiftlint --strict` 0 violations on touched files. ✅ `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp` clean. ✅ Engine test suite green (modulo `MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout` documented flake). ✅ AV.2 test suite (3 suites, 6 tests) all green. ✅ `AuroraVeilSilenceTest` continues to pass (silence fallback intact via confidence gate). ✅ `AuroraVeilContinuousDominanceTest` passes (bass mean-luma span ≥ 0.03 over [-0.8, 0.8] sweep; kink-driven MSD ≤ 10 % of bass-driven MSD). ✅ `AuroraVeilPitchHueTest` passes (8-step monotonic hue migration; max step delta 0.39 / total range 1.17 → 33 %, below 45 % threshold accommodating IQ-palette natural curvature). ✅ `PresetRegression` Aurora Veil hashes inside 8-bit Hamming threshold vs regenerated golden. ✅ Visual side-by-side sanity check: silence/mid/beat frames read as belonging in the same visual conversation as refs `01` and `04` (green base / magenta crown stratification, dark sky context, intact bottom-band silhouette, sparse stars) and clearly NOT like anti-ref `09` (no festival strobe, no pure-saturation neon, no converging cones). 9-Q authenticity rubric: Q1 ✓ Q2 ✓ Q3 partial → **improved** (multi-column gives per-column noise variation rather than horizontal-band uniformity; full close requires AV.3 sub-second flicker) Q4 N/A (multi-timescale motion deferred to AV.3) Q5 ✓ Q6 partial Q7 partial → **improved** (off-thirds anchors give off-axis composition; would fully close with more aggressive depth dimming or wider anchor spread) Q8 ✓ Q9 ✓.

**Open-question outcomes.** §AV-kink: Path B selected per recommendation (CPU-side `AuroraVeilState` class + 16-byte slot-6 buffer). Path A (shader q-var) infeasible (pf reconstructed per frame; no GPU-side persistent state). Path C (warp-feedback ghost) infeasible (preamble doesn't expose feedback texture to direct-fragment shader). Kink visual effect realised as fragment-space lateral UV jitter `kinkAmp × sin(uv.y × 12)` on the column noise sample (mv_warp y-disp would require engine plumbing to read slot 6 from mvWarpPerFrame); produces equivalent shudder reading. §AV-beatresp: invariant `beatMotion ≤ continuousMotion × 2 + 1` passes — fixtures have zero stems → kink accumulator stays at 0 → no per-beat motion above continuous baseline. §AV-perf: no observable test-suite slowdown from 3× noise sampling at AV.2 fixture resolution; explicit profiling deferred to AV.3 cert work per prompt. §AV-routing-conflicts: `f.bass_att_rel` drives brightness (amplitude) AND substrate drift speed (rate) — both retained per design §5.7; visual sanity check did not show "fighting itself." §AV-pitch-smoothing: CPU-side 5-frame moving average via `AuroraVeilState` (no `vocals_pitch_*_smoothed` in `Common.metal`; the existing `drums_energy_dev_smoothed` is the only smoothed proxy and is ferrofluid-only).

**Known follow-ups for AV.3.** Sub-second ray flicker (5–10 Hz). 2–20 s whole-curtain pulsation envelope. Matt M7 cert review against `01` / `02` / `03` / `04` + anti-ref `09`. Performance profile run against Tier-2 1.7 ms budget. Star-density / silhouette-foreground tuning if Matt flags either at M7. Final palette / amplitude tuning against curated references.

### Increment AV.2.1 — Motion-smear hotfix ✅ (2026-05-18)

**Scope.** Live-session feedback (session `2026-05-18T21-44-14Z`) reported the AV.2 scene was a "very smeary mess of aurora curtains and stars" even at silence, with no readable ribbon character. Diagnosis from extracted video frames: AV.2's per-column substrate-rotation-velocity differential (`kAuroraColumnVelocity = {1.00, 0.75, 0.55}` per `AURORA_VEIL_DESIGN.md §5.5` parallax-from-motion idea) compounded with mv_warp's ~1 s persistence trail. The MAX-merge of three columns drifting at different rates makes the "winner" column at each pixel shift over time; mv_warp accumulated those shifts into painterly smear that destroyed the nimitz vertical-streak ribbon character and washed out the stars. Reference photos `01` and `04` show depth separation via horizontal screen position + atmospheric perspective dimming — NOT differential motion (still photos don't encode velocity differentials anyway). Decision: drop the per-column velocity differential; depth distinction stays via offset + depth-scale dimming. Matt approved the "all three drift at the same pace" option in product-level framing.

Second issue surfaced in the same session video: ~1 s of full-screen magenta at the moment of preset switch into Aurora Veil. Root cause: freshly-allocated `storageMode = .private` Metal textures don't carry guaranteed zero-initialisation; whatever bit pattern previously occupied that GPU memory bled through mv_warp's compose-pass decay blend on the first frame. Fix: clear the three mv_warp textures (`warpTexture` / `composeTexture` / `sceneTexture`) to black via load-action-clear render passes immediately after allocation in `setupMVWarp`.

**Delivered.**
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/AuroraVeil.metal` — `kAuroraColumnVelocity` constant + `velocityScale` parameter removed from `aurora_tri_noise_2d` + `raymarch_column` signatures; the call site in `aurora_fragment` simplified. AV.2.1 rationale documented inline on `kAuroraColumnOffsets`.
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/RenderPipeline+MVWarp.swift` — new `clearWarpTexturesToBlack` helper called from `setupMVWarp` so first-frame compose reads black, not undefined GPU memory.
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Renderer/PresetRegressionTests.swift` — Aurora Veil `beatHeavy` golden hash drifted by 1 bit (within the 8-bit Hamming threshold; updated for accuracy).

**Done-when.** ✅ Engine builds clean. ✅ `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp build` SUCCEEDED. ✅ `swiftlint --strict` 0 violations on touched files. ✅ 6 / 6 Aurora Veil tests + 42 / 42 broader preset surface (Regression / Acceptance / Fidelity / LoaderCompile) green. ✅ `RENDER_VISUAL=1` silence frame at 1920×1280 shows crisp stars + green-base / magenta-crown stratification + dark sky context + intact bottom-band silhouette; smearing of the prior AV.2 multi-frame mv_warp accumulation gone (single-frame test render doesn't itself accumulate mv_warp; live-app re-verification is the load-bearing check — surface to Matt). The magenta-flash fix is preset-apply-only and not visible in single-frame test fixtures; live verification on next preset-switch.

**Known risks.** Live re-verification is the gate: single-frame test renders don't exercise mv_warp's frame-to-frame accumulation, so the test suite can't tell you whether the smear is actually gone in motion. The structural change (single drift rate across all columns) is the right answer per the diagnosis, but Matt should re-run a session with Aurora Veil and confirm.

### Increment AV.2.2 — Drop mv_warp pass (empirically grounded fix) ✅ (2026-05-18)

**Scope.** AV.2.1 hotfix did not resolve the smear (Matt's second live session at `2026-05-18T22-17-36Z` showed identical painterly green/magenta blobs at silence). Built a new env-gated multi-frame diagnostic test (`AuroraVeilMVWarpAccumulationTest`) that exercises the live mv_warp pipeline (scene → warp → compose → swap) for 60 frames at silence and captures the final accumulator state with quantitative star-count metrics. The diagnostic produced empirical proof of the actual root cause:

| Run | Stars in upper sky | Sky max-luma | Frame max-luma |
|---|---|---|---|
| **mv_warp ON (design)** | **0** | 0.39 | 0.54 |
| mv_warp OFF | 115 | 0.96 | 0.97 |
| mv_warp TAME (decay 0.70) | 306 | 0.85 | 1.00 |

mv_warp at the design parameters (decay 0.945 + curl_noise advection 0.005 UV per-vertex) destroys ALL high-frequency content over its ~17-frame decay window — stars, ribbon edges, sharp noise patterns — by accumulating each pixel's curl-noise random walk across frames. This is structural to the Milkdrop-pattern feedback accumulator: it works for plasma/abstract shaders where the entire frame is feedback-driven, but is incompatible with content that includes sparse pinpoints and sharp edges.

The dossier (`AURORA_VEIL_RESEARCH_2026-05-18.md`) cites six working aurora references; **none of them use a feedback accumulator like mv_warp.** Substrate drift in nimitz / Lawlor / Wittens / Theunissen comes from time-driven rotation inside the noise sample, animation of the flux map, or fluid-sim advection — never from a frame-to-frame persistence loop. The dossier's §2.1 line 121 assertion "Phosphene's mv_warp at `decay = 0.945` handles the substrate timescale" had no aurora-research citation backing it; mv_warp was smuggled into the design from Milkdrop conventions without empirical grounding.

**Delivered.**
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/AuroraVeil.json` — `"passes": ["mv_warp"]` → `[]`. Description updated to drop the "slow compounding motion via mv_warp feedback" claim and reflect that drift comes from the noise field's own rotation.
- `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/AuroraVeil.metal` — `mvWarpPerFrame` + `mvWarpPerVertex` functions removed (the preset loader's mv_warp preamble enforcement no longer fires when `passes: []`). Header docstring updated with the empirical justification + the dossier gap that allowed this to ship.
- `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/AuroraVeilMVWarpAccumulationTest.swift` — **new** — env-gated (`AURORA_VEIL_MVWARP_DIAG=1`) multi-frame harness that runs scene → warp → compose → swap for 60 frames at silence; captures sky-band star count + quantitative luma metrics; dumps three PNGs (`mvwarp_on.png` / `mvwarp_off.png` / `mvwarp_tame.png`) to `/tmp/aurora_veil_mvwarp_diag/<ISO>/` for visual inspection. Permanent regression guard against this category of bug.
- `CLAUDE.md` Authoring Discipline — two new sections promoted: (a) "Test in the production-grade rendering pipeline. No shortcuts." mandates multi-frame tests through the live dispatch path for any preset with temporal behaviour; (b) "Design is upstream of testing — surface risks immediately" + grounding-priority rule (L1 working code reference / L2 paper + math / L3 design-doc assertion alone — surface to Matt before authoring).
- `~/.claude/.../memory/feedback_production_grade_testing.md` + `feedback_research_first_design.md` — durable memory entries.

**Done-when.** ✅ All 7 AV tests + 43 broader preset tests green. ✅ App build SUCCEEDED. ✅ `swiftlint --strict` 0 violations. ✅ Diagnostic test produces quantitative proof of the mv_warp smear (mv_warp ON = 0 sky stars; mv_warp OFF = 115 sky stars). ✅ AV.2 PresetRegression golden unchanged (the regression harness was always rendering through `preset.pipelineState` direct, never through mv_warp — so dropping mv_warp from passes doesn't change the harness's output).

**Live re-verification gate.** Matt to run another live session with Aurora Veil and confirm stars + ribbons are visible, no painterly smear. Until that confirmation lands, AV.2.2 is "empirically validated in test" but not "live-confirmed." Diagnostic test stays as permanent regression guard.

### Increment AV.2.3 (planned) — Re-introduce drift mechanisms grounded in dossier

**Scope.** Replace the mv_warp-supplied motion (which AV.2.2 removed) with the dossier-grounded mechanisms the design SHOULD have used from AV.1:
1. **Curl-noise perturbation INSIDE `aurora_tri_noise_2d` sample coordinate** per dossier §1.3 line 61 — Wittens NeverSeenTheSky borrowing. The vortical-flow character mv_warp was attempting belongs here.
2. **Two-column SUM-merge instead of three-column MAX** per dossier §1.3 line 62. Volume integration for an emissive medium is summative; the AV.2 MAX-of-three was structurally wrong (and produced the winner-switching pattern that compounded under mv_warp).
3. **Multi-frame diagnostic harness extended to replay `raw_tap.wav`** from a captured session so the seven audio routes can be validated against real music BEFORE filing AV.2.3 as ✅ (per the new "test in production-grade pipeline" discipline rule). The routes have never been seen live; that's the next reliability gap to close.

**Risks acknowledged before authoring.** R1 (mv_warp+nimitz combination unprecedented) is resolved by removing mv_warp. R2 (mv_warp + high-frequency content structurally incompatible) is resolved by the same. R3 (audio routes unvalidated live) → multi-frame test replaying `raw_tap.wav` is the gate. R4 (AV.3 sub-second flicker + pulsation have no cited working code reference — only Springer/AGU physics papers) → I will surface this to Matt before AV.3 implementation and propose either finding a working reference or accepting the "L3 grounding only" risk per the soft rule.

### Increment AV.3 — Refine + cert

**Scope.** Tune palette constants, mv_warp amplitudes, fold-density coefficients against curated references. Matt M7 review against `01_macro_curtain_hero_purple_green.jpg` + `02_palette_green_to_magenta_stratification.jpg` + `03_meso_curtain_fold_drape.jpg` + `04_atmosphere_multi_curtain_parallax.jpg`. Anti-reference check against `09_anti_neon_festival_aurora.jpg`. On green: flip `certified: true`.

**Done-when.** M7 sign-off. `Aurora_Veil.json` schema validated against an actual existing preset sidecar (`Gossamer.json` is the closest match per AV_README open question) — required fields (`name` not `id`, `description`, `author`, `duration`, `fragment_function`, `vertex_function`, `beat_source`) confirmed; the `feedback` wrapper around `decay` resolved against the real schema.

**Estimated total: 3 sessions.**

## Phase CC — Crystalline Cavern (ray-march flagship preset)

A static-camera ray-march scene of a glowing geode interior — crystalline materials, screen-space caustics, light shafts, mv_warp shimmer over the lit frame. Demonstrates the D-029-preserved combination of `ray_march` + `mv_warp` (no current preset uses this) and exercises the entire V.1–V.4 utility library in a single shader. **Flagship piece.** Tier-2 primary. Authoritative design at [docs/presets/CRYSTALLINE_CAVERN_DESIGN.md](presets/CRYSTALLINE_CAVERN_DESIGN.md); reference set **not yet curated** (CC.0 prerequisite).

**Concept-viability gate (SHADER_CRAFT §2.0).** All three gates clear before CC.1 starts:

1. **Musical role (one sentence).** *"The crystal cavern's caustics flash on drum onsets (`stems.drums_energy_dev` — beat-coupled accent), the IBL ambient breathes with sustained bass (`f.bass_att_rel` — continuous primary), and the caustic refraction angle drifts continuously with vocals pitch — so the listener pairs kicks with caustic flashes, sustained bass with the scene brightening, and the melody with the way light bends through the crystal cluster."* Names three specific musical features paired with three specific visual behaviours per CLAUDE.md FA #58 / D-102.
2. **Iconic visual subject deliverable at fidelity.** Full rubric profile. This is the flagship — the fidelity bar is the *highest* in the catalog. Tier 2 6.5 ms budget; comparable past preset Glass Brutalist uses the same stack (ray-march + post-process + SSGI) and demonstrates the fidelity is achievable. **Risk acknowledged**: per CLAUDE.md Authoring Discipline ("treat Matt's fidelity warnings as constraints"), the flagship target is ambitious; if any session produces output that does not read against the curated references, the right action is to escalate to "this preset doesn't have a viable design at this fidelity target" rather than continue tuning (FA #58 lesson).
3. **Infrastructure-feasible.** Uses existing V.1–V.4 utilities. One amber: screen-space caustics utility (`Volume/Caustics.metal`) has no production consumer and may have rough edges (CC_DESIGN §4). CC.3 has a documented fallback (`fbm8` overlay) if the utility output is unworkable.

**Status.** Planned. **Schedule:** waits on LM, Arachne V.7.10 cert review, and Aurora Veil cert. Crystalline Cavern is positioned as the demonstration-of-ceiling piece for collaborators / external review — landing it after at least one other M7-certified non-Arachne preset (e.g. Aurora Veil) reduces the risk that it ships with rough edges that pull down the catalog's perceived quality.

### Increment CC.0 — Reference curation

**Scope.** Curate the reference set per CC_DESIGN §2 — geode interior cathedral, crystal termination close-up, cave caustics, wet limestone wall, bioluminescent cave, pattern glass close-up, anti-reference video-game crystal cave, anti-reference Tron neon. Author `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/crystalline_cavern/README.md` with per-image annotations matching the Aurora Veil README format. Confirm against `CheckVisualReferences --strict` (V.5).

**Done-when.** Reference set complete; README annotations include mandatory / decorative / actively-disregarded traits per D-065; anti-references named explicitly.

### Increment CC.1 — Scene structure (no materials)

**Scope.** Cavern walls (4-plane intersection with `worley_fbm` displacement), central crystal cluster (5 hex-prism SDFs with hash-driven per-instance jitter), floor crystals, hanging tips. Default white-on-grey rendering. Static camera composition framing. No materials, no audio coupling.

**Deliverables.** `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/CrystallineCavern.metal` (sceneSDF, sceneMaterial stubs returning matID only). `CrystallineCavern.json` (full rubric profile, certified: false). `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest.expectedProductionPresetCount` bumped.

**Done-when.** Composition reads correctly against geode reference photography (Matt eyeball, not a formal M7 yet). Engine + app builds clean. Visual harness emits a default-fixture PNG.

### Increment CC.2 — Materials pass

**Scope.** Wire `mat_pattern_glass`, `mat_polished_chrome`, `mat_wet_stone`, `mat_frosted_glass` via `sceneMaterial`. Triplanar detail normals on cavern walls. Per-instance hash-jitter on crystal cluster (CLAUDE.md FA #44 lesson). `CrystallineCavernMaterialBoundaryTest` passes.

**Done-when.** Four materials visibly present and stable across material boundaries. PresetAcceptance D-037 invariants pass. SwiftLint clean.

### Increment CC.3 — Lighting + atmosphere + caustics

**Scope.** Bioluminescent §5.3 lighting recipe (warm key, blue-purple IBL, emission on pattern-glass + frosted-glass crystals). IBL palette × `lightColor.rgb` for valence tint (D-022 path). Volumetric ground fog via `vol_density_height_fog`. Light shafts via `ls_radial_step_uv`. Screen-space caustic projection.

**Validation gate.** Verify `Volume/Caustics.metal` produces workable output at CC's geometry scale. **If unworkable**, fall back to procedurally-animated `fbm8` overlay sampled at the floor projection (documented in CC_DESIGN §4 / §5.4). The fallback is a one-session detour; the cert-quality target is still the real caustic utility if it works.

**Done-when.** Lighting + atmosphere + caustics rendering coherently. Tier 2 kernel cost ≤ 6.5 ms; Tier 1 ≤ 5.0 ms (with the degradation path: SSGI off, caustic samples halved, ray-march steps 64 → 48).

### Increment CC.4 — Audio routing + mv_warp + cert

**Scope.** All eight audio routes from CC_DESIGN §5.6 wired (IBL bass breath / key bass breath / caustic flash drums-dev / caustic refraction vocals-pitch / IBL valence tint / shimmer mid-rel / mid-pulse caustic offset beat-phase / crystal emission bass+valence). mv_warp at conservative shimmer amplitude (≤ 0.003 UV, per CC_DESIGN §5.5 / D-029 lesson). All four preset-specific tests green (`CrystallineCavernSilenceTest`, `CrystallineCavernCausticBeatRatioTest`, `CrystallineCavernMaterialBoundaryTest`, `CrystallineCavernMvWarpStaticityTest`). Matt M7 review against curated references. On green: flip `certified: true`.

**Done-when.** M7 sign-off. Rubric score ≥ 14/15 (potential 15/15 with thin-film inclusion per CC_DESIGN §5.5).

**Estimated total: 4 sessions** (this is the flagship; complexity is justified by the demonstration value).

**Open questions per CC_DESIGN §11.** (1) `architectural` family enum value vs. existing categories; (2) caustic utility production-readiness — validated in CC.3; (3) POM on cavern walls — deferred until after first Matt review; (4) Tier 1 acceptable-degradation tradeoff vs. tier-2-only gating; (5) thin-film inclusion in CC.5 polish if rubric score 14 → 15 is wanted.

## Phase NB — Nimbus (first volumetric-family preset)

First consumer of the V.2 Volume tree (`Utilities/Volume/*`). Single-pass 2D direct-fragment volumetric ray-march; `family: volumetric` (new `PresetCategory` case, Matt-authorized 2026-06-04, D-140). Design of record: `docs/presets/NIMBUS_DESIGN.md`; plan: `docs/presets/NIMBUS_PLAN.md`. Tier 2 (M3+) only (`complexity_cost.tier1` above the Tier-1 ceiling → Orchestrator excludes on M1/M2).

### Increment NB.0 — Reference lock ✅ (committed 2026-06-04, precondition baseline)
Curated 10-image reference set + README (D-065(c) annotations + `05_anti_*`) in `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/nimbus/`; `NIMBUS_DESIGN.md` + `NIMBUS_PLAN.md`. Found uncommitted at NB.1 start; committed as the precondition baseline. **Follow-up:** `06_palette_cool_baseline.jpg` (manifest slot) is absent from disk — re-source it (the cool target is specified in prose meanwhile).

### Increment NB.1 — Macro maquette ✅ (2026-06-04) — budget resolved via noiseVolume (NB.1.1)
**Delivered.** `Nimbus.metal` (single-scatter volumetric march: ellipsoidal envelope × eroded detail; 64-step front-to-back; `hg_phase(·,0.4)`; 6-step envelope self-shadow; cool-indigo tint; ACES; true-black void; density-only + step-count debug `#define`s). `Nimbus.json` (`passes:[]`, family volumetric, certified:false, rubric full, `complexity_cost {tier1:9.0, tier2:6.0 provisional}`). `PresetCategory.volumetric` (D-140). `expectedProductionPresetCount` 18→19. `NimbusBudgetProbeTests` (env-gated). `PresetVisualReviewTests` arg + noiseVolume parity binding + `PresetTests` allCases 11→12.
**Visual:** maquette reads — single coherent gaseous body, denser/brighter core, soft fraying edges, true-black void, framed per `01_macro_coherent_body` (Matt eyeball pending).
**Budget gate — fired then RESOLVED (DESIGN §6.1):** the original computed-noise march was over budget (p50 20.2 ms @1080p; 7.5 ms even @half-res). Diagnosis: the cost was the per-step `fbm4` ALU (voronoi removal was a wash). Fix (NB.1.1, Matt-directed): sample the preamble `noiseVolume` 64³ 3D texture (production-bound on the direct path) instead of computing `fbm4` → **p50 1.37 ms @1080p, within Tier-2 at full res with ~5.6 ms headroom** (look improved). Stays inside NB.1's mandate (noiseVolume is preamble-injected + production-bound; only test paths gained a parity binding, FA #66).

### Increment NB.2 — Meso/micro detail cascade ✅ (2026-06-04)
**Delivered.** `Nimbus.metal` detail field rebuilt into the macro→meso→micro cascade (SHADER_CRAFT §2.2), all `noiseVolume`-sampled (no computed per-step noise — §6.1 rule held): **meso** nested billow lobes (two octave-doubled scales q*0.7/q*1.4) that *carve the envelope multiplicatively* (valleys thin toward transparency → distinct lumps, not the saturated solid-surface egg); **micro** domain-warped fine filaments (warp via two cheap decorrelated `noiseVolume` taps, never `fbm_vec3`/`warped_fbm`) + multiplicative rim filament-mask → peeling curling tendrils dissolving into the void (no hard cut); **interior turbulence** on the named `kNimbusTurbulence` knob (placid↔churning, NB.6 wires arousal). Extinction σ 2.1→1.55 so the translucent body's front-to-back accumulation reads lobe depth with no new lighting (lobe-to-lobe shadow is NB.3). 4 noise octaves (0.7/1.4/2.8/5.6) → §12.1 floor. Test/prod parity: both test paths (`PresetVisualReviewTests`, `NimbusBudgetProbeTests`) now bind the full noise set via `TextureManager.bindTextures` (slots 4–8), matching production exactly (FA #66).

**Budget (re-measured, NIMBUS_DESIGN §6.2):** macro+meso+micro **p50 1.65 ms @1080p** (vs NB.1 macro 1.37 ms) — +0.28 ms for doubling samples 3→6/step, because the envelope early-out keeps most steps free. 0.24× the 7 ms Tier-2 ceiling, well under the NB.2 ≤~3 ms target; ~5.35 ms headroom preserved for NB.3–7. **Recipe:** SHADER_CRAFT §6.5 — the first V.2-Volume-consumer entry (envelope shaping, multiplicative billow carve, translucent-σ depth, domain-warp-on-texture-coords, texture-noise budget rule). Visual: density-only guard shows a bounded body with dominant negative space + feathered edges (not anti-uniform-fog, not anti-solid-surface); step-count heatmap confirms early-out localizes cost. Matt eyeball (contact-sheet-style), not a formal M7. `certified:false` unchanged.

### Increment NB.3 — The look: HZD/Nubis cloud-port + fidelity uplift ✅ (2026-06-04 → 2026-06-05)
**Delivered.** Replaced the NB.1/NB.2 Perlin-FBM blob with the ported Horizon: Zero Dawn / "Nubis" volumetric-cloud technique (Perlin-FBM cannot make billows — §0 Direction reset):
- **NB.3.0** — baked a tileable 3D **Perlin-Worley** texture (`gen_perlin_worley_3d` in `NoiseGen.metal`: RGBA = PW base + 3 inverted-Worley detail octaves) in `TextureManager`, auto-bound on the direct path (the one engine touch).
- **NB.3.1** — density from PW billows (R) carved by Worley detail (G/B/A), HZD-remapped against the analytic envelope as coverage → bounded body + feathered cauliflower edges. Off-lattice sample offset kills a 4-fold mirror symmetry.
- **NB.3.2** — backlit lighting: forward-scatter HG + a detail-aware ~6-step **cone self-shadow** march → luminous backlit billows.
- **NB.3.3 — fidelity uplift (Matt-directed, reference-aligned).** Closed the three reference-packet gaps **strictly within the backlit model — no emission**: coverage-gated interior billow/crevice contrast (ref 02, soft rim ref 03), a radial denser core for substance (ref 01), +15% on-screen size via focal zoom (`kNimbusFocal` 1.25→1.44), and the forward-scatter silver-lining glow + brightness lift (ref 08). An egg-core / internal-emission / "incandescent" exploration was tried and **reverted** as a divergence — the packet is a BACKLIT cool body (light scattering *through* the medium), not an emissive one (durable note in `NIMBUS_DESIGN.md §5.2`). Matt-approved on the render-vs-packet contact sheet.

**Budget (NIMBUS_DESIGN §6.3):** p50 **3.27 ms @1080p**, 0.47× the 7 ms Tier-2 ceiling — within, ~3.7 ms headroom for NB.4→NB.6. **Gates:** 1378 engine tests green; SwiftLint `--strict` clean; app build clean; `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` at 19; density-only guard clears anti-fog + anti-solid; mode-2 heatmap intact; debug toggle at 0. Still NO audio coupling (NB.4) and NO mood (NB.6); `certified:false` unchanged (cert is NB.9).

### Increment NB.4 — Energy (Breath): bloom → size + brightness + flow + silence floor ✅ (2026-06-05)

**Delivered.** The hero coupling (DESIGN §1.3) — the first and only Energy driver, no beat, no mood. `NimbusState.swift` (new, `Sources/Presets/Nimbus/`; `public final class @unchecked Sendable` + NSLock, mirrors `AuroraVeilState`): a fast-attack (~150 ms) / slow-release (~400 ms) one-pole follower over the broadband energy deviation `(bass_att_rel+mid_att_rel+treb_att_rel)/3` (D-026 — never absolute thresholds, FA #31) → `bloom`; a `flowPhase` accumulated in `Double` (long-accumulator rule) at a bloom-modulated rate; flushed to a 16-byte `NimbusStateGPU` (`bloom`, `flowPhase`, 2× pad) at fragment buffer(6). Shader (`Nimbus.metal`): reads `constant NimbusStateGPU& nb [[buffer(6)]]` (byte-matched MSL mirror; orthogonal to `noiseVolume` at *texture* 6) and consumes `bloom` for **body extent** (uniform `bodyScale` inflation of the whole field, `mix(0.80,1.16,bloom)` → +45 % floor→peak; bound sphere + cone-shadow reach grow with it), **luminosity** (`bright = mix(0.65,1.17,bloom)` → +80 % floor→peak, scaling the back-key + ambient together so the backlit rim-vs-core contrast is preserved), and `flowPhase` for the **gas drift** (replaces wall-clock `features.time` in `nimbus_density`; 1×→3.5× via `flowFloor`/`flowPeak` in state). Silence floor = the NB.3 backlit look, smaller/dimmer/slower over a faint non-black cool **haze** halo (D-037 — concentrated near the body, dark corners → negative space preserved, NOT anti-uniform-fog). Live wiring in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` (`if desc.name == "Nimbus"` → alloc + `reset()` + `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer` + `setMeshPresetTick`), `nimbusState` ivar, teardown null, **track-change `reset()`** in `VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift` (body settles into the new track rather than carrying the prior bloom).

**Tests.** `NimbusBloomFollowerTest` (new): Part A asserts the asymmetric follower feel (floors at silence, fills under energy, reaches half FASTER up than down, flow never freezes); Part B renders the converged silence-floor + full-bloom states through the **live direct dispatch path** (`preset.pipelineState` + slot-6 buffer + noiseVolume) and asserts silence non-black (D-037) + energetic brighter + bigger. `PresetVisualReviewTests` gains Nimbus-specific silence/mid/energy fixtures (explicit AttRel) + per-fixture `NimbusState` priming + slot-6 bind. `NimbusBudgetProbeTests` binds a primed slot-6 buffer (FA #66 parity).

**Budget (NIMBUS_DESIGN §6.4):** p50 **2.66 ms @1080p** (steady-mid, bloom ~0.5), 0.38× the 7 ms ceiling — the CPU follower adds no GPU cost; full-bloom worst case ~3.6 ms est. **Gates:** 1380 engine tests green; SwiftLint `--strict` clean; app build clean; `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` at 19; contact sheet shows the bloom range (silence small/dim/slow-non-black → mid ≈ NB.3 → energy big/bright/fast) with the backlit look preserved. **No beat / no mood verified by source inspection.** `certified:false` unchanged. **Remaining gate: Matt's live manual-validation sign-off on "feels married to the music" (non-bypassable — automated tests prove the route fires, not that it feels musical).**

### Increment NB.5 — Beat: stem lobes (the band plays the body) ✅ (2026-06-05, D-141)

**Reverses the "nothing on the beat" premise (D-141).** The first real-music test of NB.4 (the *Atlas* / Battles session, a relentless 136-BPM track) showed the energy-only bloom **too subtle** and, on bass-dominated music, structurally floored: `bloom` averaged 3 bands and with mid (0.04) / treble (0.004) near-silent the dead bands vetoed it — the body sat at floor-size all session while the beat (beatComposite > 0.5 on 53 % of frames, grid locked) went unanswered; meanwhile all four stem deviations swing hard (peaks 1.9–2.8). Matt's call: drive from the beat, per stem; chose "one mass heaves per-stem" over hard quadrants.

**Delivered.** `NimbusState` gains four fast-attack/slow-release stem followers — `kickPunch` (drums; `max(beatBass,beatComposite)` onset pulse, zero-delay frame 1, blended to `drumsEnergyDev` via D-019 warmup), `bassLobe`/`vocalsLobe`/`otherLobe` (stem `…EnergyDev`); `bloom` re-sourced to the mean of the four stem **energies** (fixes the 3-band floor). `NimbusStateGPU` 16→32 bytes. Shader: `nimbus_envelope` heaves the **single** body per stem (`rr/(1 + kick + Σ lobe·cos²)` — star-convex, cannot fragment, protecting the §1.4 one-mass identity): drums punch + brighten the whole body, bass heaves DOWN, lead flares UP, other swells to the SIDE; the bound grows by the live bulge so a heave never clips. **FA #4 honoured** — beat is an accent on top of the slow bloom; safe here (no feedback loop, zero-delay pulse, soft-decay heave forgives ±80 ms).

**Tests.** `NimbusBloomFollowerTest.test_stemLobes` (new): renders baseline/bloom/kick/bass/vocals/other through the **live direct path**, asserts each follower fires only for its stem, the luma-weighted centroid shifts the right way (bass down, vocals up, other side), drums brighten+inflate the whole body, and every fixture stays one present mass. NB.4 follower tests + budget probe + visual review carried forward (slot-6 = 32 bytes).

**Budget (NIMBUS_DESIGN §6.5):** p50 **3.74 ms @1080p**, 0.53× the 7 ms ceiling — within, ~3.3 ms headroom for NB.6. **Perf lesson:** `pow(cos,1.5)` for the lobe falloff doubled the budget to 5.15 ms (the GPU predicates the guard — paid even at rest); cos² (pure mul-adds) → 3.74 ms. Never use `pow()` in a per-march-step falloff. **Gates:** 1381 engine tests green; SwiftLint `--strict` clean; app build clean; `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` at 19; per-stem contact sheet shows directional heaves on one coherent mass. `certified:false` unchanged. **Remaining gate: Matt's live manual-validation sign-off (does the body feel like it's playing with the band?).**

### Increment NB.3.4/.5 — Smoke qualities (texture + rising/curling motion) ✅ (2026-06-05)

After the NB.5 live test read as a static blurry blob, Matt reframed: smoke/cloud is defined by how it MOVES. **Texture (NB.3.4):** 2-octave fractal Worley detail cascade + interior cauliflower carve (lump/crevice contrast throughout) + bigger base billows (scale 0.55→0.40). **Motion (NB.3.5):** replaced the linear noise drift with rising/curling smoke — vertical rise + helical twist + a 2-octave organic swirl warp (billows roll over each other) + faster-churning detail, on the flowT bloom clock. Motion character "rising curling smoke" (Matt's call); 2 Matt-provided motion references recorded in `NIMBUS_DESIGN §1.2`. Budget (§6.6): the naïve version hit 20 ms — fixed with a **cheap shadow density** (`nimbus_density_shadow`, 1 sample — the cone self-shadow only needs coarse depth), 64 steps, and a 10 % smaller blob (Matt-directed) → 3.78 ms. Perf lessons: never `pow()` in a per-step falloff; match step count to the finest kept octave; on-screen area is a linear budget lever. `NimbusBloomFollowerTest.test_motionStrip`. Matt-approved ("looks good, proceed").

### Increment NB.8 — Performance tranche (half-res render path) + beat-sync ✅ (2026-06-05)

The 2nd Atlas live session showed the body **swelling to fill the frame** at full energy costs **mean 6.84 / max 14.5 ms, 56 % of frames over the 7 ms ceiling** — every prior budget probe under-measured by priming the steady-mid body, not the swell (durable lesson: profile a volumetric preset at its WORST on-screen body). **Fix: a half-resolution direct-render path** — Nimbus's fragment renders to a 0.5× offscreen texture + bilinear upscale (`feedback_blit` + linear-clamp sampler); ~4× cheaper → worst-case ~3 ms (the §5.5 MetalFX reserve was never wired, and MetalFX Temporal needs motion vectors a procedural volume lacks, so a simple upscale substitutes). Engine: `RenderPipeline.setDirectRenderScale` + `drawDirect` branch + `encodePresetVisualization`/`halfResTarget` (new `RenderPipeline+DirectDraw.swift`); opt-in per-preset (others unaffected). `complexity_cost.tier2` 6.0→**4.0** from the corrected worst-case profile. **Beat-sync** tightened: the kick now fires from the predicted grid beat (anticipatory `smoothstep(0.82,1,beatPhase01)`, peaks ON the beat) with the onset as fallback — vs the ~80–120 ms onset lag. **Gates:** 1384 engine tests green (incl. `test_halfResUpscale` + corrected worst-case probe + updated AV.2.2a slot-6 guard); SwiftLint clean; app build clean; count 19. Budget §6.7/§6.8. **Remaining: Matt's live sign-off on the half-res look + the tighter beat.**

### Increment NB.6 — Mood (valence→colour, arousal→agitation) ✅ (2026-06-05)

The last feature before cert. `NimbusState` smooths valence + arousal ~4 s (FA #25 — from the FeatureVector, never written back; D-024), stored in the former GPU pad floats (`NimbusStateGPU` stays 32 bytes, byte-layout unchanged). Shader: **valence → body colour** (`mix(indigo, gold, valence01)` at composite, with the ambient fill + haze halo warming too → the whole mass shifts cool↔warm, D-022 propagation); **arousal → flow agitation** (`mix(0.65, 1.55, arousal01)` drives the detail-erosion strength — calm = smoother lobes, energetic = torn/fraying edges; replaced the compile-time `kNimbusTurbulence`). Verified: `NimbusBloomFollowerTest.test_moodTravel` (cool R/B 0.71 → warm R/B 1.79) + the cool/warm/calm/wild contact strip; the visual-review fixtures set a cool valence so the contact sheet still matches the 06-cool references. 1385 engine tests green; SwiftLint clean; app build clean; count 19. Deferred (don't block cert): per-track-distinct gas seed + PresetSessionReplay registration. **Pending Matt's live sign-off; then NB.9 cert.**

### NB.9 — certification ✅ **CERTIFIED by Matt (M7, 2026-06-05, session 20-33-47Z, 8 tracks)**

**Phase NB complete — Nimbus is the first certified `volumetric`-family preset (D-140).** M7 history: r1 (session 18-26-37Z) + r1.5 (19-03-04Z) did NOT certify, but both unknowingly ran the **stranded old `main` Nimbus** (the NB.10 changes were on a worktree branch the build never saw — see [[feedback_worktree_changes_reach_build]]); the first build with the real changes (after integration to main) passed on session 20-33-47Z. Cert state: `Nimbus.json` `certified: true`; `"Nimbus"` added to `certifiedPresets` in `FidelityRubricTests` (heuristic gate false-by-construction — volumetric, no `mat_*`/`fbm`; the M7 reference review is the load-bearing gate per SHADER_CRAFT §12.1). Accepted-at-cert limitation: **beat-grid live phase** ("too active / not synced" on some tracks, e.g. Love Shack) is bounded by the shared cached-grid phase, deferred to its own infrastructure project **D-145** (after Skein). Noted future enhancement (Matt): **extend the mood palette beyond cool-purple ↔ warm-gold** (a richer colour family) — `NIMBUS_DESIGN §8`. Session-artifact confirmation: per-track bloom p50 0.44–0.61 (vs the pre-r1.6 0.13) and warmth read matched Matt's live calls track-for-track (Love Shack/In Undertow/No Surprises/Love Rehab/Atlas warm, Pyramid Song cool, Sad Song + A Girl In Port travel).

**Earlier (round-1) automated prep ✅; the M7 round-1/1.5 narrative:**
Per `NIMBUS_PLAN.md`: ~~NB.7 Page (CUT — §1.3)~~ → NB.9 certification. NB.5-as-Pulse cut; NB.8 done early; mood (NB.6) done. A certified Nimbus = the band playing one packet-matching cool-gas body: beat (per stem) + energy swell + mood, fitting Tier-2 budget via the half-res path.

**Automated prep landed (M7-independent).**
- **§5.7 acceptance audit + two new gates.** Mapped every §5.7 bullet to a gate (closeout table). Silence-non-black, energy primacy (bloom→size/bright), flow-alive, valence→colour, perf — already covered (`NimbusBloomFollowerTest`, `NimbusBudgetProbeTests`, `PresetAcceptanceTests` inv. 1–4, which Nimbus already clears as a `direct` preset). Two gaps filled in `NimbusBloomFollowerTest`: (1) **body coherence / negative space** (`test_bodyCoherenceNegativeSpace`) — at the absolute worst case (full bloom + max kick + all three lobes), the body stays a bounded mass (coverage 0.668 < 0.80 ceiling) with dark corners (corner/centre 0.082 < 0.30) → ≠ `05_anti_uniform_fog` (the single worst failure, §1.4); (2) **arousal→agitation route-live** (extends `test_moodTravel`) — calm↔wild MSD 84.3 ≫ 0 proves the second mood axis carries signal (partner to the valence→colour assertion).
- **Golden dHash registered** in `PresetRegressionTests` — Nimbus now binds a zeroed slot-6 `NimbusStateGPU` (deterministic silence-floor body) and registers `0x0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F` (identical across all three fixtures, because the shader reads no FeatureVector field but `aspect_ratio`). A centred-body fingerprint sensitive to silhouette / backlit-lighting / haze regressions.
- **Stale `Nimbus.json` description** refreshed to the shipped band-plays-the-body reality (was "Look being rebuilt… nothing fires on the beat" — both false post-NB.3/NB.5).
- **M7 artifacts generated** — contact sheet (render vs 3 TRUST refs + 2 AVOID anti-refs; render clearly rejects both anti-refs), silence/mid/energy bloom range, rising/curling motion strip (8 frames), cool/warm/calm/wild mood strip, per-stem lobe sheet, worst-case budget (half-res p50 **2.56 ms**, within the 7 ms ceiling).
- Gates: **1386 engine tests green** (the only failures are the pre-existing gitignored-`Tests/Fixtures/` absence in a fresh worktree — `love_rehab.m4a` et al.; restoring the fixtures makes the suite 1386/1386); SwiftLint `--strict` 0/424; app build clean; `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` 19.

**M7 round 1 (session `2026-06-05T18-26-37Z`, 7 tracks) — Matt would NOT certify.** Two findings, different root causes (diagnosed from the session csv): **(a) mood colour too subtle / sometimes wrong** — Billie Jean "white/gray", B.O.B. "purplish — why? energetic". Root cause: a perfectly good valence signal was washed out downstream (bright-core desaturation to near-white + muted poles + valence-only mapping). → **NB.10 (D-144), done below.** **(b) beat behind / not locked to downbeats** — root cause: the shared beat-grid's *live phase* (grids lock with correct tempo, but cached-grid phase is imperfect on live audio; meter assumed simple). This is the system-level Cold-Start Phase limit (FA #69), NOT a Nimbus shader bug. Matt's call: **open the beat-grid as its own project (D-145)**; Nimbus's beat axis waits on it. Cert flip steps unchanged (`certified` false→true + `"Nimbus"` → `certifiedPresets` in `FidelityRubricTests` + doc sweep + `RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY`), still gated on a passing M7. **No push without Matt's "yes, push."**

### NB.10 — mood expressiveness uplift (energy warms it) ✅ (2026-06-05, D-144) — pending M7 r2
Addresses M7 r1 finding (a). Pure `Nimbus.metal` shader change (no state change — `bloomV` + `arousal` already in `NimbusStateGPU`): **(1)** colour now driven by *warmth* = `valence01` lifted by `energy01 = 0.55·arousal01 + 0.55·bloomV`, expanded around mid (`kNimbusMoodContrast`) — an energetic track reads hot even at neutral/low valence (the B.O.B. fix); **(2)** the bright core keeps its **mood hue** (brightened), no longer washing to near-white (the Billie Jean "white/gray" fix); **(3)** saturated poles (vivid indigo-violet ↔ rich amber/gold), ambient + haze warm with `warm01` too. Gates: `test_moodTravel` valence R/B **0.85→3.11** (was 0.71→1.79) + a NEW energy-warmth assertion (neutral valence, low↔high energy R/B **0.85→2.89**) locking the B.O.B. fix; mood strip shows a vivid violet cool pole / rich gold warm pole / gold high-energy-neutral-valence body; the golden hash is unchanged (dHash is luma-gradient, hue-invariant). **1386 engine tests green; SwiftLint 0/424; app build clean; count 19.** All hues are starting points — Matt's eye sets the finals.

**NB.10 r1.5 correction (2026-06-05, same day) — D-144 amended.** The v1 energy-warmth *regressed* live (M7 r1.5, session `2026-06-05T19-03-04Z`: "clobbered… displays neutral"). Root cause (reconstructed `warm01` from the session): the `+0.6·(energy01−0.25)` lift added a flat warm bias to every moderate-energy track, collapsing the cool↔warm range (Sad Song → gold). Fix: warmth primarily valence; energy-warmth AROUSAL-gated past a high threshold (only bangers warm); contrast 1.35→1.60; `moodTau` 4.0→2.5 s (colour travels instead of fading to the mean). Re-verified on the session (In Undertow cool 0.33, range restored). The classifier reads "Sad Song" as +0.11 valence (audio-mood ≠ title-mood) so it renders warm-ish regardless of the shader — a classifier characteristic. 1386 tests green; SwiftLint clean; app build clean; count 19.

**NB.10 r1.6 bloom recalibration (2026-06-05, same day; Matt: "input problem, solve permanently") — D-144 amended.** The small/dim bodies (which made the mood colour hard to see) are NOT a quiet-capture/input issue — I first wrongly blamed Spotify normalization; Matt confirmed it off + 100 % volume. Root cause (measured): `{stem}Energy` is the stem's 3 AGC bands **summed**, but the AGC normalises the *6-band total* to 0.5, so a 3-band sum centres at ~**0.30** (measured p50 0.24/0.27/0.41 across 3 sessions), not the 0.5 the bloom assumed — so `bloom = meanStem·1.4−0.2` gave ≈ 0.13 (tiny) on normal music; Atlas only looked right as an unusually dense master. Fix: `NimbusState` `bloomGain` 1.4→1.9, `bloomOffset` −0.2→−0.06. Verified: meanStem 0.27 → bloom **0.45** (was 0.18), dynamic range kept (0.14→0.21, 0.55→0.98), silence floors at 0. Regression-locked by `test_bloomVisibleOnTypicalMusic`. **Same mis-calibration class as BUG-027** (every energy value centres ~0.3 not 0.5) — the system-wide normalisation fix is BUG-027's domain (its own project, re-tunes every preset). Makes Nimbus bodies bigger on all music (Atlas re-judged at M7 r2). **1387 tests green; SwiftLint 0/424; app build clean; count 19.**

### D-145 — beat-grid live-phase as its own project (deferred from Nimbus)
Matt opened the shared beat-grid's live-phase quality as a separate workstream (M7 r1). The felt "behind the beat / wrong downbeat" is bounded by the cached-grid phase, not Nimbus — and per FA #69 any work here needs a *new premise* (not another short-window live-tap iteration). Scoping note: `docs/diagnostics/BEAT_GRID_LIVE_PHASE_PROJECT_2026-06-05.md` (the M7 r1 diagnosis + candidate premises). Nimbus's beat axis (kick timing / downbeat feel) waits on this; the mood uplift (NB.10) does not.

## Phase Skein — action-painting / drip-pour preset (`painterly`)

New preset in the Dragon Bloom lineage (D-135 / D-138): a Pollock-style poured / dripped **action-painting** visualiser whose canvas is a persistent, **lossless** feedback accumulation (paint lands, stays, is occluded only by later opaque paint-over-paint — the temporal-integral canvas). Design: `docs/presets/SKEIN_DESIGN.md`; plan: `docs/presets/SKEIN_PLAN.md`. Critical path: Skein.0 → ENGINE.1 → Skein.1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 6; wet-sheen (ENGINE.2 + Skein.4) is the explicit cut-line branch.

### Skein.0 — Reference lock ✅ (2026-06-05)
Reference set curated + Matt-approved; `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/skein/` populated, `CheckVisualReferences` green (commits `07a4a57b` / `52ebfe3d`). Anti-reference images + the V.6 rubric profile deferred per the Skein.0 closeout.

### Increment Skein.ENGINE.1 — Canvas-hold accumulation path ✅ (2026-06-05, D-142)
Establishes the persistent, lossless paint canvas: **identity warp + no decay + no R→G→B transfer + marks-on-top**, the no-decay / identity **configuration** of the mv_warp brush-on-feedback paradigm (a sibling of Dragon Bloom — D-142). **Audit verdict: config-only — no PhospheneEngine source change, no new warp mode** (the four properties are reachable as per-preset config; `decayMul = (chromaticMix>0)?1.0:in.decay` proves no-decay is *not* bound to the colour transfer). Files: `Skein.metal` (identity `mvWarpPerFrame` decay=1.0 / `mvWarpPerVertex` returns `uv` + a `skein_fragment` toned-ground + fixed test stamp), `Skein.json` (`passes:["direct","mv_warp"]`, decay 1.0, uncertified, no `family` yet), `SkeinCanvasHoldTest.swift` (new), `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` count 19→20. **`SkeinCanvasHoldTest` proves whole-frame Hamming 0 across 130 hold frames** through the live scene→warp→blit→swap dispatch path (sRGB feedback; sRGB round-trip + identity-at-pixel-centers both exact → no linear-format / nearest-sampler override needed). **Gates:** 1388 engine tests green; `PresetRegressionTests` byte-identical for every other preset (no shared code touched); MVWarp/StagedComposition green; app build clean; SwiftLint `--strict` clean (424 files); contrast + acceptance gates pass for Skein. **Flagged for Skein.1+:** ~~app-wiring de-entanglement of "scene-geometry ⟹ Dragon Bloom chromatic+comp" + generalize `makeSceneGeometryPipeline` names~~ → **DONE in Skein.ENGINE.1.1 (D-143)**; the light-canvas-vs-white-chrome WCAG contrast tension (ENGINE.1 uses a darkened toned-ground placeholder — still deferred per D-142(b)); `family: painterly` + the `PresetCategory` case (still deferred per D-142(c)). **Pending Matt's sign-off (the increment gate).**

### Increment Skein.ENGINE.1.1 — Per-preset marks-on-top + cream ground ✅ (2026-06-05, D-143)
Clears the ENGINE.1 "flagged for Skein.1" de-entanglement (a) and makes **Skein render live for the first time** (cream ground + held test disc through the real pipeline). The D-138 marks-on-top half was hard-wired to Dragon Bloom in three places; generalising them touched SHARED mv_warp wiring (a D-137 beachball risk), so this lands as its own gated, golden-regression-locked infra patch **before** Skein.1. **Audit verdict: smallest additive change — existing presets resolve exactly as before, only a new per-preset path is added.** The three couplings → per-preset: (1) `PresetLoader.makeSceneGeometryPipeline` resolves `<prefix>_geometry_*` (legacy `dragon_bloom_strand_*` fallback; stale "additive blend" doc fixed → normal alpha); (2) a new optional **`marks` descriptor block** (`vertex_count`/`instance_count`/`primitive`/`chromatic`/`comp`/`beat_pulse`) drives draw params + chromatic + comp + the comp beat pump (gated by `marks.beat_pulse`, was `sceneGeometryState != nil`); (3) per-preset **canvas-clear colour** on `MVWarpPipelineBundle`/`MVWarpState` → `clearWarpTextures(to:)` from `marks.canvas_clear`. Dragon Bloom's block carries its exact literals (1536/3/lineStrip, chromatic 1.0, comp 1/0.5/1.07, beat on) → byte-identical. Skein: `skein_fragment` → flat cream GROUND; the fixed disc → `skein_geometry_*` fullscreen-triangle overlay (hard-edged so the per-frame redraw is idempotent), `chromatic=0`, black-free cream clear. Files: `PresetLoader.swift`, `PresetDescriptor.swift` (`MarksConfig`), `RenderPipeline+MVWarp.swift` / `+PresetSwitching.swift` / `RenderPipeline.swift` / `MVWarpTypes.swift`, `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`, `DragonBloom.json` (+`marks`), `Skein.metal` / `Skein.json` (+`marks`), `SkeinCanvasHoldTest.swift` (marks-on-top test), `PresetAcceptanceTests.swift` (Skein readable-form exemption). **Gates:** engine suite green except 7 pre-existing `love_rehab.m4a`-fixture-absent failures (git-ignored licensed clip, unrelated); `PresetRegressionTests` + `DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest` + `FataMorganaMVWarpAccumulationTest` byte-identical; new marks-on-top test green (disc on cream, `chromatic=0` Hamming-0 over 130 frames, `chromatic=1.0` cycles) through the live scene→warp→overlay→blit→swap path; PresetAcceptance + PresetContrast green for Skein; app build clean; SwiftLint `--strict` clean. **Pending Matt's sign-off (the increment gate).**

### Increment Skein.1 — Canvas + pour spike ✅ (2026-06-05, commits `57ee7383` / `528021b5`) — pending Matt's eyeball gate
Replaces the ENGINE.1.1 static test disc with a **single white pour LINE traced by a wandering "painter,"** accumulating losslessly on the cream canvas. No audio (driven by `features.time` only). This is the **gate-before-the-gate** (SKEIN_DESIGN §7): does a persistent skein hold + read as poured paint? **Audit verdict: pure preset increment — no engine touch, DB/FM byte-identical by construction.** **Trajectory decision — Path A (closed-form, in-shader):** the marks-on-top overlay binds `features` only at the **vertex** stage (`drawSceneGeometryOverlay:36`, no fragment binding), so the painter position is computed in `skein_geometry_vertex` (which already reads `features@0` — the same slot `dragon_bloom_strand_vertex` reads) and passed to the fragment as varyings; the fragment draws a swept-capsule 2D-segment SDF from `painter(t−Δt)` → `painter(t)`, AA'd (each capsule stamped once then held, so no in-place re-blend). **No CPU state, no per-preset buffer, no engine touch** — Path B (`SkeinState` + a gated overlay-buffer binding) was correctly **deferred to a future ENGINE.1.2** when Skein.2's stateful painter needs it (FA #59/#60). Trajectory: three gesture scales per axis at non-harmonic (incommensurate) frequencies — a slow drift carrying the painter across the canvas (the §1.0 fact-2 island-then-join build order) + gesture loops (~6 s) + tight loops (~2.5 s), all in the gesture band; the loops are the GESTURE (§1.0 fact 1), never a coiling/noise term; width rides 1/speed (pools at turning points, filament on sweeps — §1.0/§1.2, refs 02/03). **Trailing-off (Matt eyeball-pass refinement, `8b8d167d`):** the pour's leading END thins + fades to a point via a closed-form tapering tail over the painter's last ~0.67 s (the VisComp 2014 line layer — width tapers toward the endpoint as the stream thins). A *fully*-persistent trailing-off (the whole recent stretch fading) is the wet-now/dry-past device (§1.4) and needs the deferred wetness channel (Skein.ENGINE.2); the in-shader tail is the achievable Skein.1 approximation. Files: `Skein.metal` (pour line replaces the disc), `SkeinCanvasHoldTest.swift` (the disc hold test → the **accumulation + hold + continuity** gate, + env-gated contact sheet). `Skein.json` unchanged. **Gates:** the new pour gate green through the **live** scene→warp→overlay→blit→swap path advancing `features.time` (256², chromatic=0, 180 frames): accumulation `[128,211,301,422]` (monotone + grows), early-painted texel persists, unpainted far corner byte-identical frame0→final, continuity = **1.000** (single connected component), cream ground + white line; full engine suite green except the same 7 `love_rehab.m4a` fixture-absent failures; `PresetRegressionTests` + DB/FM accumulation byte-identical; `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` preset count intact (no silent MSL drop); PresetAcceptance + PresetContrast green for Skein; app build clean; SwiftLint `--strict` clean (424 files). **Eyeball artifact:** `RENDER_VISUAL=1`/`SKEIN_VISUAL=1` contact sheet at ~2/5/10/20 s (480×270, live path) — a continuous wandering pour line accumulating with gesture loops + crossings + pool/filament width contrast. **No new capability** (Path A uses the Supported canvas-hold + marks-on-top rows) — registry instances refreshed disc→pour line, no status flip. **Deferred (unchanged):** `family: painterly` + the `PresetCategory` case (D-142(c)/D-143 — a product-taxonomy / engine-touch decision, not in Skein.1's pure-preset scope); per-track seed (Skein.3); the ENGINE.1.2 overlay-buffer binding (opens with Skein.2). **Pending Matt's eyeball gate** (SKEIN_PLAN: if a persistent skein doesn't hold + read as paint, the concept stops here).

### Increment Skein.2 — Splatter morphology + viscosity ✅ (2026-06-05) — Matt eyeball PASS (cert at Skein.6)
Adds the **splatter vocabulary** to the held canvas alongside the Skein.1 pour line: velocity-biased **droplet bursts** (ragged 2D-noise edges, exp/poly satellite size+density falloff with distance — the VisComp 2014 *droplet* layer), thin **filament tendrils**, and a **viscosity axis** (thin-fast-fine ↔ thick-slow-gloopy) shaping every mark — all baked normal-alpha into the same lossless canvas. **No audio:** bursts fire on a deterministic flick schedule; viscosity is a closed-form **debug** sweep of `features.time` (period ~12 s) so a *still frame* exhibits the full morphology. Real onset→splatter / centroid→viscosity / stem→colour routing + the per-track seed are Skein.3. **Audit verdict — Path A extended (closed-form, in-shader): no engine touch, no `SkeinState`, no per-preset buffer; DB/FM byte-identical by construction.** Confirmed with file:line evidence that `drawSceneGeometryOverlay` (`RenderPipeline+SceneGeometry.swift:36-37`) binds `features` only at the **vertex** stage (no fragment buffer — Dragon Bloom shares this code, so a Path-B per-preset buffer would be a gated D-137-risk engine touch); the splatter needs neither multi-frame droplet flight nor per-stem accumulators (paint **lands and the canvas holds it** — §1.4), so everything is a deterministic **hash of (flick, droplet)** generated in `skein_geometry_fragment`, plus a debug viscosity computed in `skein_geometry_vertex` and passed as a varying. ENGINE.1.2 (`SkeinState` + the gated overlay buffer) stays **deferred to Skein.3**, its real consumer (FA #59/#60; SKEIN_DESIGN §7). **Two iteration findings (the highest-aesthetic-risk increment, as called):** (1) big+dense+ragged droplets merge into "cauliflower froth" → fixed with **small+crisp+wider-flung+fewer DISTINCT dots**; (2) straight line→droplet filaments radiate as a **sci-fi starburst** (= the particle-burst anti-reference) → **forward-gated, short, sparse** so they read as directional spray-streaks. Ragged edges use a new **`skein_fbm2`** (4-octave `perlin2d`, inter-octave rotation, sampled at non-lattice scaled coords → FA #43-clear); AA from the smooth radial distance with raggedness in the threshold radius; per-flick + per-droplet scissor early-outs keep cost ∝ this frame's marks (§6). Viscosity → line-width factor floors at **1.0** (only widens) so the Skein.1 continuity invariant is preserved. Files: `Skein.metal` (`skein_fbm2` + `skeinDebugViscosity` + splatter/filament/viscosity in `skein_geometry_fragment` + the `visc` varying; the canvas-hold mv_warp config + `skein_fragment` cream ground untouched), `SkeinCanvasHoldTest.swift` (corridor-isolated pour-LINE continuity + a new splatter test: halo dense-near/sparse-far, viscosity response, opaque-not-additive, satellite bake/hold, per-frame new-mark count + a viscosity-sweep contact sheet). `Skein.json` unchanged. **Gates:** all 5 Skein tests green through the **live** scene→warp→overlay→blit→swap path — pour-LINE corridor continuity **1.000** (Skein.1 invariant preserved) + 1158 satellite pixels outside the corridor; splatter halo near/mid/far THIN 692/418/32 vs THICK 210/47/0 (dense-near ✓); viscosity response THIN 64 satellites @ meanSatDist 0.057 > THICK 18 @ 0.043 (more + wider ✓); opaque minCh = cream (no mud ✓); 178/179 frames added marks (new-mark count ✓). Full engine suite green except the same 7 pre-existing `love_rehab.m4a` fixture-absent failures; `PresetRegressionTests` + `DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest` + `FataMorganaMVWarpAccumulationTest` byte-identical; `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` count intact (no silent MSL drop — FA #72); PresetAcceptance + PresetContrast green for Skein; app build clean; SwiftLint `--strict` clean (424 files). **Eyeball artifacts:** `SKEIN_VISUAL=1` accumulation contact sheet (960×540, ~2/5/10/20 s) + a **viscosity-sweep** sheet (thin | thick poles, independent fresh accumulations) through the live path; all 5 anti-references checked clear (matte not neon; ragged not polka-dots; pour not brush; ~9 % coverage not dead-mat; asymmetric not kaleidoscope). **No new capability** (Path A = nothing engine-side; registry instances refreshed, no status flip). **Deferred (unchanged):** `family: painterly` + `PresetCategory` case; per-track SHA seed + audio routing + ENGINE.1.2 (all Skein.3); wetness/sheen (ENGINE.2/Skein.4). **M7 round 1 (2026-06-05, live session `2026-06-05T22-59-05Z`, Mingus, 900×600):** Matt — "looks good"; flagged that **droplets read as rounded-SQUARES** (flat cardinal edges). Root cause (verified by zooming the live frame to the pixel level): the droplet AA used `fwidth(length(q−dpos))`, whose gradient is the radial unit vector → ~41 % wider AA at the diagonals than the cardinals → sharp cardinal edges snap to the axis-aligned pixel grid. **Fix:** isotropic `px = max(fwidth(q.x), fwidth(q.y))` AA + a `max(drr, px·1.5)` radius floor (so sub-2 px far satellites still read round). Droplets now round (bbox-fill 0.65–0.70 vs square ~1.0), regression-locked by a roundness gate in `SkeinCanvasHoldTest`; SHADER_CRAFT §18.3 corrected. Two non-code M7 items deferred: **colour** (white-on-cream is the deliberate Skein.2 boundary → stem palette lands at Skein.3) and **pacing** (a slow accumulator wants longer on-screen segments + energy-coupled painter speed — addressed at Skein.3 when speed ties to arousal/energy, plus `duration` tuning). **M7 round 2 (2026-06-05): Matt eyeball PASS** ("looks good") on the round droplets — Skein.2's aesthetic gate is met (a still frame reads as poured paint, not a particle fountain, with a believable droplet/halo/filament structure and a visible viscosity axis). Preset *certification* (full M7 ≥5 tracks + soak + determinism + golden dHash) remains **Skein.6**; `certified` stays false. Integrated to local `main` (merge `1310c1c4`, alongside the parallel AGC2 / D-146 merge `a07b2a56`; NOT pushed).

## Phase G-uplift — Gossamer + remaining preset fidelity uplifts

The Phase V uplift trajectory left several presets at the post-V.6 cert baseline without per-preset fidelity work tailored to their visual contracts. The shipped catalog has 15 presets (post-D-102); the Phase V plan called for 12 fidelity-uplifted presets. Several catalog members are *certifiable* but have *not* been through a per-preset uplift session against curated references — Gossamer is the named example, but Membrane / Starburst (post-SB) / Nebula / Plasma / Waveform / Fractal Tree / TestSphere / Glass Brutalist / Kinetic Sculpture / Volumetric Lithograph / Spectral Cartograph are all worth review (some are lightweight rubric and need only validation, others are full rubric and may need work).

**Status.** Planned, behind LM / Arachne / AV / CC. Per-preset scoping happens at session start — each preset gets its own concept-viability gate review against SHADER_CRAFT §2.0 before scoping the uplift; if the gate finds the preset's musical role is unarticulated or ambiguous, the uplift is rescoped (or, per D-102 / FA #58, retired rather than tuned).

**Suggested order** (subject to Matt prioritisation):

1. **Gossamer uplift** — the highest-priority named uplift target. Bioluminescent silk web preset; ambient family. Likely benefits from a palette / motion / silence-fallback pass against curated references. Per-preset increment estimate: 1–2 sessions.
2. **Membrane uplift** — fluid-family direct-fragment preset; Matt has flagged the silence behaviour as historically thin. 1–2 sessions.
3. **Starburst** — post-SB.1 / SB.2 stability + any remaining fidelity gaps surfaced by review. 1 session.
4. **Plasma / Nebula / Waveform / Spectral Cartograph** — lightweight rubric profile; primarily validation rather than rework. ½–1 session each.
5. **Glass Brutalist / Kinetic Sculpture / Volumetric Lithograph** — full rubric profile; cert-quality validation + any preserved tuning gaps. 1 session each.
6. **TestSphere / Fractal Tree** — final cleanup pass; TestSphere may be retired as a production preset if its diagnostic role is no longer load-bearing.

**Done-when (phase-level).** Every catalog member has either (a) been M7-certified by Matt, or (b) been explicitly retired with a D-XXX entry (the D-102 / Drift Motes precedent applies — retirement is acceptable when the concept-viability gate fails).

These milestones map to product-level outcomes, not implementation phases.

**Milestone A — Trustworthy Playback Session.** ✅ **MET (2026-04-25).** A user can connect a playlist, obtain a usable prepared session, and complete a full listening session without instability. *Requires: ~~2.5.4~~ ✅, ~~Phase U increments U.1–U.7~~ ✅, ~~progressive readiness basics (6.1)~~ ✅.*

**Milestone B — Tasteful Orchestration.** ✅ **MET (2026-04-25).** Preset choice and transitions are consistently better than random and pass golden-session tests. *Requires: ~~Phase 4 complete~~ ✅, ~~Increment 5.1~~ ✅ (landed as 4.0).*

**Milestone C — Device-Aware Show Quality.** ✅ **MET (2026-04-25).** The same playlist produces an excellent show on M1 and a richer one on M4 without jank. *Requires: ~~Phase 6 complete~~ ✅.*

**Milestone D — Library Depth.** ⏳ **IN PROGRESS — 1 / 22+ certified (2026-05-12).** The preset catalog is large enough, varied enough, and well-tagged enough for Phosphene to feel like a product rather than a tech demo. *Requires: Phase 5 complete, Phase V complete (12 fidelity-uplifted presets), Phase AV + Phase CC complete (Aurora Veil + Crystalline Cavern shipped certified), Phase G-uplift complete (Gossamer + remaining catalog members M7-certified or explicitly retired), Phase MD through MD.5 minimum (10 Milkdrop presets), 22+ certified presets total.* **First certified preset: Lumen Mosaic** (Phase LM closed 2026-05-12; BUG-004 resolved). Next cert candidates per current sequencing: Arachne V.7.10, Aurora Veil (Phase AV), Phase G-uplift members.

**Milestone E — Visual Identity.** Phosphene's preset catalog has a recognizable aesthetic ceiling that reads as 2026-quality — comparable to indie-game-released visuals, not 2006-era ShaderToy. *Requires: Phase V complete, Phase V.7–V.11 uplifts all Matt-approved, Phase CC certified (the flagship demonstration piece), accessibility pass (U.9).*
