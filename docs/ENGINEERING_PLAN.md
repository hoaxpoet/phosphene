# Phosphene — Engineering Plan

## Planning Principles

- One increment = one reviewable outcome that fits a Claude Code session.
- Product quality and show quality are both first-class.
- No new subsystem lands without tests appropriate to its risk.
- Documentation follows implementation truth, not aspiration.
- Infrastructure increments and preset increments are never bundled.

## Current State

The foundation is implemented and tested:

- Native Metal render loop with data-driven render graph
- Core Audio tap capture with provider abstraction and DRM silence detection
- FFT (vDSP 1024-point → 512 bins) and full MIR pipeline (BPM, key, mood, spectral features, structural analysis)
- MPSGraph stem separation (Open-Unmix HQ, 142ms warm predict) and Accelerate mood classifier
- Session lifecycle: `SessionManager` drives `idle → connecting → preparing → ready → playing → ended`
- Playlist connection (Apple Music AppleScript, Spotify Web API)
- Preview resolver (iTunes Search API) and batch downloader
- Batch pre-analysis with StemCache; cache-aware track-change loading (no warmup gap in session mode)
- Metadata pre-fetching (MusicBrainz, Soundcharts, Spotify search, MusicKit)
- Feedback textures, mesh shaders (M3+ with M1/M2 fallback), hardware ray tracing, ICBs
- Ray march pipeline with deferred G-buffer, PBR lighting, IBL, SSGI
- HDR post-process chain (bloom + ACES tone mapping)
- Noise texture manager (5 textures via Metal compute)
- Shader utility library (55 functions across 7 domains)
- Preset library: Waveform, Plasma, Nebula, Murmuration, Glass Brutalist

Test infrastructure: swift-testing + XCTest across unit, integration, regression, and performance categories. SwiftLint enforced. Protocol-first DI with test doubles.

## Recently Completed

### Increment 2.5.4 — Session State Machine & Track Change Behavior ✅

`SessionManager` (`@MainActor ObservableObject`, `Session` module) owns the lifecycle. `startSession(source:)` drives `idle → connecting → preparing → ready`. Graceful degradation: connector failure → `ready` with empty plan; partial preparation failure → `ready` with partial plan. `startAdHocSession()` → `playing` directly (reactive mode). `beginPlayback()` advances `ready → playing`. `endSession()` from any state → `ended`.

Key implementation decisions: `SessionState`/`SessionPlan` live in `Session/SessionTypes.swift` (not `Shared`) because `Shared` cannot depend on `Session`. Cache-aware track-change loading already existed in `resetStemPipeline(for:)` from Increment 2.5.3 — no changes required there. `VisualizerEngine` gained a `sessionManager: SessionManager?` property; the app layer wires `cache → stemCache` on state transition to `.ready`.

11 tests.

### Increment 3.5.2 — Murmuration Stem Routing Revision ✅

Replaced the 6-band full-mix frequency workaround with real stem-driven routing via `StemFeatures` at GPU `buffer(3)`.

`Particles.metal` compute kernel gains `constant StemFeatures& stems [[buffer(3)]]`. Routing: **drums** (`drums_beat` decay drives wave front position) → turning wave that sweeps across the flock over ~200ms, not instantaneously; direction alternates per beat epoch; **bass** (`bass_energy`) → macro drift velocity and shape elongation; **other** (`other_energy`) → surface flutter weighted by `distFromCenter` (periphery 1.0×, core 0.25×); **vocals** (`vocals_energy`) → density compression via `densityScale = 1 - vocals * 0.22` applied to `halfLength` and `halfWidth`.

Warmup fallback: `smoothstep(0.02, 0.06, totalStemEnergy)` crossfades from FeatureVector 6-band routing to stem routing. Zero stems → identical behavior to previous implementation.

`ProceduralGeometry.update()` gains `stemFeatures: StemFeatures = .zero` parameter. `Starburst.metal` gains `StemFeatures` param; `vocals_energy` shifts sky gradient ≤10% warmer.

8 new tests in `MurmurationStemRoutingTests.swift`. 288 swift-testing + 91 XCTest = 379 tests total.

### Increment 3.5.4 — Volumetric Lithograph Preset ✅

New ray-march preset: tactile, audio-reactive infinite terrain rendered with a stark linocut/printmaking aesthetic. Uses the existing deferred ray-march pipeline; no engine changes required.

`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/VolumetricLithograph.metal` defines only `sceneSDF` and `sceneMaterial`; the marching loop and lighting pass come from `rayMarchGBufferPreamble`.

- **Geometry:** `fbm3D` heightfield over an infinite XZ plane. The noise's third axis is swept by `s.sceneParamsA.x` (accumulated audio time) so topography continuously morphs rather than scrolls. Vertical amplitude scaled by `clamp(f.bass + f.mid, 0, 2.5)`. SDF return scaled by 0.6 to keep the marcher Lipschitz-safe on steep ridges.
- **Bimodal materials:** Valleys → `albedo=0, roughness=1, metallic=0` (ultra-matte black). Peaks → `albedo=1, roughness∈[0.06, 0.18], metallic=1` (mirror-bright). Pinched smoothstep edges (0.55→0.72) read as printed lines.
- **Beat accent:** Drum onset shifts the smoothstep window down (`lo -= drumsBeat × 0.18`) so the bright peak region *expands* across the topography on transients. The deferred G-buffer has no emissive channel, so coverage expansion is the contrast-pulse story.
- **D-019 stem fallback:** `StemFeatures` is not in scope for `sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial` (preamble forward-declarations omit it — same as KineticSculpture). Uses `f` directly: `max(f.beat_bass, f.beat_mid, f.beat_composite)` for the drum-beat fallback (CLAUDE.md failed-approach #26 — single-band keying misses snare-driven tracks); `f.treble * 1.4` for the "other" stem fallback (closest single-band proxy for the 250 Hz–4 kHz range).
- **Pipeline:** `["ray_march", "post_process"]` — SSGI intentionally skipped to preserve harsh, high-contrast shadows.
- **JSON:** `family: "fluid"`, low-angle directional light from above-side, elevated camera looking down at terrain, far-plane 60u, `stem_affinity` documented (drums→contrast_pulse, bass→terrain_height, other→metallic_sheen).

Verified by the existing `presetLoaderBuiltInPresetsHaveValidPipelines` regression gate, which compiles and renders every built-in preset through the actual G-buffer pipeline. No new test files required — the gate covers the new preset automatically.

### Increment 3.5.4.1 — Volumetric Lithograph v2 ✅

Session recording (`~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-04-16T16-44-51Z/`, 2,633 frames against Love Rehab — Chaim) revealed four problems with v1: beat fallback `max(beat_bass, beat_mid, beat_composite)` was saturated 86% of the time (median 0.62, p90 1.0) so the peak/valley boundary flickered every frame; pure-grayscale palette read as sepia, not psychedelic; `f.treble × 1.4` polish driver was effectively zero (treble mean 0.0006); and `scene_fog: 0.025` produced an unwanted hazy band across the upper third because the camera was looking down past the fogFar = 40u line.

v2 changes:
- **Calmer motion**: terrain amplitude switched to attenuated bands `f.bass_att + 0.4 × f.mid_att`; `VL_DISP_AUDIO_AMP` 3.4 → 1.8; noise time scale 0.15 → 0.06; noise frequency 0.18 → 0.12 (larger features, slower morph).
- **Selective beat**: `pow(f.beat_bass, 1.5) × 0.7` replaces the saturated `max(...)` — only strong kicks register.
- **Beat as palette flare, not coverage shift**: peak/valley smoothstep window stays geometrically stable; transients push peak palette into HDR bloom instead of flickering the boundary.
- **Sharper edges**: smoothstep window tightened (0.55, 0.72) → (0.50, 0.55); added a thin ridge-line seam (0.495 → 0.51) as a third low-metallic stratum that reads as a luminous "cut paper" highlight.
- **Psychedelic palette**: `palette()` from `ShaderUtilities.metal:576` (IQ cosine palette — first preset to use it) drives peak albedo from `noise × 0.45 + audioTime × 0.04 + valence × 0.25`. Cyan-magenta-yellow rotation via `(0, 0.33, 0.67)` phase shift. Albedo IS F0 for metals (RayMarch.metal:239) so saturated colors produce saturated reflections.
- **Stem-proxy correctness**: `sqrt(f.mid) × 1.6` replaces `f.treble × 1.4` for the polish driver — `f.mid` (250 Hz–4 kHz) overlaps the actual "other" stem range, and `sqrt` boost handles AGC-compressed real-music values.
- **Atmosphere**: `scene_fog` 0.025 → 0; `scene_far_plane` 60 → 80; `scene_ambient` 0.04 → 0.06; camera lowered to `[0, 6.5, -8.5] → [0, 0, 7]` so fewer sky pixels, more terrain.

Same regression gate covers compilation/render. No new tests.

### Increment 3.5.4.2 — Volumetric Lithograph v3 + shared fog-fallback bug fix ✅

Two issues surfaced during v2 visual review on Love Rehab:

**Bug 1 (shared infra):** `PresetDescriptor+SceneUniforms.makeSceneUniforms()` line 85 had a broken `scene_fog == 0` fallback: it reused `uniforms.sceneParamsB.y` which starts at SIMD4 default 0. The shader formula `fogFactor = clamp((t - 0) / max(0 - 0, 0.001), 0, 1)` then saturates to 1.0 for any terrain hit — so "no fog" actually produced **maximum fog everywhere**. Fixed: fallback now returns `1_000_000` (effectively infinite fogFar), matching the intuitive "0 means no fog" semantic. No test impact — no existing preset set `scene_fog: 0`.

**Rebalance (v3):** v2 over-corrected. `pow(f.beat_bass, 1.5) × 0.7` with `× 0.6` palette brightness multiplier produced visually inert beat response on energetic music — ACES squashed the boost back into SDR before post-process bloom could amplify it. v3 changes:
- Drum-beat fallback: `pow(f.beat_bass, 1.2) × 1.5` (saturates at beat_bass ≈ 0.7 rather than never).
- Palette flare: × 1.5 (was × 0.6) — peaks push to 2.5× albedo on strong kicks, bloom-visible.
- Ridge seam strobe: `× (1.4 + beat × 2.0)` — the cut-line itself strobes at up to 3.4× brightness.
- Coverage expansion on beat: 0.03 smoothstep shift (v1 had 0.18 which flickered every frame; v2 had 0 which was dead).
- Transient terrain kick in `sceneSDF`: `f.beat_bass × 0.35` added to attenuated baseline amp — landscape breathes on kicks without replacing the slow-flowing base.

Same regression gate covers both changes.

### Increment 3.5.4.3 — v3.1 palette tuning ✅

Data analysis of the v2 diagnostic session (`2026-04-16T17-33-10Z`, 3,749 active frames on Love Rehab) surfaced three palette-level issues that the v3 fix alone did not address:

1. **Palette rotation too slow**: `accumulatedAudioTime × 0.04` only advanced 0.20 over 64 seconds of playback (20% of one color cycle). All sampled frames read as the same teal because the palette barely rotated. Bumped to × 0.15 — one full cyan→magenta→yellow cycle every ~7 seconds of active audio.
2. **Spatial hue spread too narrow**: peak pixels exist where noise n ∈ [0.55, 1.0], so `n × 0.45` capped the peak contribution at 0.20 — all peaks in a single frame looked the same hue. Bumped to × 0.9 — doubles per-peak variation so different ridges show different colors.
3. **Valley brightness too low**: `palette(phase + 0.5) × 0.08` was drowned out by the valence-tinted IBL ambient; valleys read as uniform dark brown rather than complementary palette color. Bumped × 0.08 → × 0.15.

Same regression gate. Landed alongside v3 fixes.

### Increment 3.5.4.4 — v3.2 "pulse-rate too fast" + sky tint ✅

Matt's visual review of v3.1 (session `2026-04-16T18-24-43Z` on Love Rehab):
1. **"Pulsing faster than the beat"** — v3.1 had ~35% of the terrain classified as peaks (smoothstep lo=0.50 sat right at the fbm mean), noise shimmer at `audioTime × 0.06` drifting high-octave detail fast, and palette rotation at 0.15 — all continuous, non-beat-locked motion. Beat-aligned flares (flare, strobe, kick) existed but drowned in the background activity.
2. **"Neutral gray backdrop"** — v3's fog fix exposed the raw `rm_skyColor` sky, which skipped the `scene.lightColor` multiplier that fog already used. On a preset with a warm `[1, 0.94, 0.84]` light, the sky stayed blue-gray.

Fixes:
- Peak coverage: smoothstep window `(0.50, 0.55) → (0.56, 0.60)` — peaks now ~15% of scene (linocut "highlights on paper"), ridge band `(0.495, 0.51) → (0.555, 0.565)`.
- Noise time scale `0.06 → 0.015` (4× slower high-octave drift).
- Palette rotation `0.15 → 0.08` (~1 cycle per preset duration).
- **Shared fix** (RayMarch.metal:208): miss/sky pixels now multiplied by `scene.lightColor.rgb`, matching the fog-colour treatment. Benefits every ray-march preset with a non-white light colour (Glass Brutalist, Kinetic Sculpture, VL).

Same regression gate.

### Increment 3.5.4.5 — v3.3: correct beat driver (f.bass, not f.beat_bass) ✅

Matt flagged that v3.2 pulses still didn't sync with the driving kick on Love Rehab. Session `2026-04-16T18-44-45Z` diagnostic:

**Rising-edge analysis of `f.beat_bass` in a 4-second window** revealed intervals of **410/403/421/397/435/418/431/399/488 ms** → mean **420ms = 143 BPM**. Love Rehab is 125 BPM (480ms intervals). **Local-maxima analysis of the continuous `f.bass`** revealed intervals of **499/526/495/504/531/452/549 ms** → mean **508ms = 118 BPM**, within normal variation of the real 125 BPM kick.

**Root cause**: `f.beat_bass` has a 400ms cooldown (CLAUDE.md "Onset Detection"). On tracks with dense off-kick bass content (syncopated basslines, double-time sub-bass), the cooldown causes beat_bass to phase-lock to the 400ms window itself rather than the real kick — producing a consistent phantom tempo that's faster than the music. This is a music-dependent failure mode of the onset detector, not a VL bug, but it affects any preset that reads `f.beat_bass` directly.

**Fix (VL-local)**: Switched all beat-aligned drivers from `f.beat_bass` to `smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass)`. `f.bass` is the continuous 3-band bass energy with no cooldown gating — its peaks naturally align with real kicks. Smoothstep shape gives clean 0→1 transitions matching the kick rhythm. Also removed the `0.4 × f.mid_att` contribution from `slowAmp` — mid band has ~4.6 onsets/sec (hi-hat/clap) on Love Rehab, which was leaking a non-kick rhythm into the terrain amplitude.

**Out of scope for this increment**: `f.beat_bass` cooldown-phase-lock affects other presets (Kinetic Sculpture, Glass Brutalist via shared Swift path, Ferrofluid Ocean). Worth following up on at the engine level — either shorten cooldown, or prefer a stem-separated kick onset (when `stems.drumsBeat` is fixed — session data also showed it firing only 2 times in 90s, which is a separate engine bug).

Same regression gate.

### Increment 3.5.4.6 — v3.4: use f.bass_att (pre-smoothed), not f.bass threshold ✅

Matt flagged v3.3 beat sync was still wrong AND motion was too sharp. Session `2026-04-16T18-56-59Z` diagnostic revealed:

**v3.3's `smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass)` fires at 65 BPM on a 125 BPM track** — half tempo. Root cause: Love Rehab's f.bass peaks in this session range 0.20–0.31. Kicks at the low end (0.20–0.23) never cleanly cross the 0.22 threshold, so only LOUDER kicks trigger a rise. Result: phantom half-tempo rhythm.

**Smoothstep with narrow range (0.22, 0.32) produces near-binary 0→1 output.** That's the "sharp, less smooth" character — visible motion was a 2-frame transition rather than a gradual envelope.

Cross-driver analysis tested five alternatives against the 125 BPM target:
- `smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass)` — 65 BPM (current v3.3, half-tempo)
- `smoothstep(0.13, 0.32, f.subBass)` — 111 BPM (better)
- `smoothstep(0.10, 0.25, f.bass_att)` — 121 BPM ✓
- `smoothstep(0.08, 0.22, f.bass_att)` — **127 BPM** ✓✓
- `f.bass_att × 4 clamped` — 126 BPM ✓

**Fix (v3.4)**: drive everything from `f.bass_att` (the 0.95-smoothed bass band). It catches every kick via smoothing (no threshold-miss), is inherently smooth (no sharpening artefacts), and tracks at 127 BPM on a 125 BPM track. Single driver replaces the two-stage design:
- `sceneSDF`: `audioAmp = clamp(f.bass_att × 3.5, 0, 2.0)` (was slow `f.bass_att` + sharp `smoothstep(f.bass) × 0.40`)
- `sceneMaterial`: `drumsBeatFB = smoothstep(0.06, 0.25, f.bass_att)` (was `smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass)`)

Same regression gate.

### Increment 3.5.4.7 — v4: melody-primary drivers + forward dolly ✅

Matt tested v3.4 on Tea Lights (Lower Dens — acoustic/electric guitar, no kick drum). Result: total failure. v3's bass-only drivers had nothing to track. Also asked about forward camera motion.

Session `2026-04-16T20-09-44Z` data showed:
- `f.mid_att × 15` tracks melodic phrasing at 72 BPM on Tea Lights (matches song tempo).
- `f.spectral_flux` fires at ~190 BPM on *any* timbral attack — kicks, guitar strums, vocal onsets, piano chord changes.
- Stem data (`stems.vocalsEnergy` 0.30 mean, `stems.otherEnergy` 0.26 mean) is the true melody carrier but isn't in `sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial` preamble scope.

Changes:
- `sceneSDF audioAmp`: melody-primary blend — `0.75 × clamp(f.mid_att × 15, 0, 1.5) + 0.35 × clamp(f.bass_att × 1.2, 0, 1)`.
- `sceneMaterial accentFB`: `smoothstep(0.35, 0.70, f.spectral_flux)` replaces bass-keyed driver. Flare multipliers reduced (× 1.5 → × 0.8 peak, × 2.0 → × 1.0 ridge, 0.03 → 0.02 coverage shift) for softer ambient match.
- Palette phase adds `f.mid_att × 3.0` — colour rotates with melodic phrasing.
- Amplitude reduced 1.8 → 1.4 to pair with dolly.
- Camera lifted Y 6.5 → 7.2, FOV narrowed 60 → 55, **forward dolly at 1.8 u/s** via new switch in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` (replaces ternary; pattern extensible for future presets).

### Increment 3.5.4.8 — SessionRecorder writer relock + StemFeatures in preamble ✅

Two follow-ups from v4, both explicitly requested by Matt. Bundled because both surfaced in the same diagnostic loop and both are prerequisites for clean next-iteration work.

**A. SessionRecorder writer relock.** Session `2026-04-16T20-09-44Z` lost 1,861 frames (~31s) because the writer locked to transient Retina-native drawable dimensions (1802×1202) observed for the first 30 frames, then rejected every subsequent frame at the steady-state logical-point size (901×601). The old guard was correct in spirit (avoid locking to transient launch-time dimensions) but couldn't recover when the "stable" size itself was the transient.

Fix: if the drawable arrives consistently at a different size for `writerRelockThreshold` (90) frames after initial lock, tear down the current writer, remove the partial `video.mp4`, and recreate at the new size. Conservative enough that it doesn't trigger on normal mid-session resizes (which should still be rare). Test `test_recordFrame_relocksWhenDrawableStabilisesAtDifferentSize` simulates the exact Tea Lights scenario.

**B. `StemFeatures` in `sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial` preamble.** Opens per-preset stem routing (Milkdrop-style) to the entire ray-march preset pipeline. The preamble forward-declarations, G-buffer fragment call sites, and all 4 existing presets gain a `constant StemFeatures& stems` parameter:

- `TestSphere`, `GlassBrutalist`, `KineticSculpture`: parameter added for signature conformance, unused internally — existing visual behaviour preserved (GB still ships its Option-A design, KS still uses its validated FeatureVector routing as commented in the header).
- `VolumetricLithograph`: upgraded to true stem reads with D-019 warmup fallback. Terrain amp melody now reads `stems.other_energy + stems.vocals_energy` (with `f.mid_att × 15` fallback); accent now reads `stems.drums_beat` (with `f.spectral_flux` fallback); peak polish reads `stems.other_energy` (with `sqrt(f.mid) × 1.6` fallback). All blended via `smoothstep(0.02, 0.06, totalStemEnergy)` so the first few seconds before stem separation completes fall back gracefully to FeatureVector routing.
- Test fixtures in `RayMarchPipelineTests.swift` and `SSGITests.swift` updated to match the new signature — this actually repairs `RayMarchPipelineTests` which was failing before v4 with undefined-symbol errors because the fixture was stale for the earlier sceneMaterial signature change.

Verified: `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetLoaderTests` 12/12 passing (including the full-pipeline render gate), `RayMarchPipelineTests` 10/10 passing, `SSGITests` 7/7 passing, `SessionRecorderTests` 7/7 passing (including the new relock test).

### Increment 3.5.4.9 — Per-frame stem analysis (engine-level) ✅

Session `2026-04-16T20-56-46Z` diagnostic on Tea Lights revealed the architectural root cause of repeated "terrain stops moving but colours keep changing" failures: **`StemFeatures` values in GPU buffer(3) update only once per 5-second stem separation cycle**. The uploaded `stems.csv` showed only 25 unique `drumsBeat` values across 8,987 rows (0.3% uniqueness); identical vocals/drums/bass/other energies held for 300+ consecutive frames then stepped to a new set. Any preset reading stems directly got a piecewise-constant driver with 5-second freeze-then-jump dynamics — no matter how careful the shader design.

**Root cause** (`VisualizerEngine+Stems.runStemSeparation`): after each 5s `StemSeparator.separate()` call, the engine ran a 600-frame AGC warmup loop on `stemQueue` and uploaded ONLY the final frame's features via `pipeline.setStemFeatures(features)`. The intermediate frames — which DO produce continuously-varying output when fed sliding windows of the same waveform — were discarded.

**Fix** (preserves 5s separation cadence, adds per-frame analysis):
- `runStemSeparation` now stores the separated waveforms + wall-clock timestamp under a new `stemsStateLock`, then returns. No analyzer calls or GPU uploads from `stemQueue` any more.
- `processAnalysisFrame` (called on `analysisQueue` at audio-callback rate, ~94 Hz) reads the latest stored waveforms under lock, slides a 1024-sample window through them at real-time rate (starting 5s into the 10s chunk, advancing by `elapsed × 44100` samples), runs `StemAnalyzer.analyze` on the window, and uploads the result via `pipeline.setStemFeatures`. AGC warms up naturally over the first ~60 frames of each new chunk.
- `resetStemPipeline` clears the stored waveforms on track change so stems don't leak across tracks.

**Cadence improvement**: 1 stem upload every 5000 ms → 1 upload every ~10 ms. **500× more frequent**.

**Latency**: stem features lag real audio by ~5-10s (separator works on past audio and we scan the last 5s of each chunk). Acceptable because musical sections persist longer than that. A future enhancement could shorten the chunk or overlap separations.

**Side benefit**: `stems.csv` in future SessionRecorder dumps now shows continuously-varying per-frame values instead of 5s-flat blocks, making preset diagnostics far cleaner.

**Tests**: new `StemAnalyzerTests.swift` pins the sliding-window contract so future refactors can't silently regress:
- `stemAnalyzer_slidingWindows_produceVaryingFeatures` — feeds sliding 1024-sample windows through a ramped waveform, asserts non-zero spread + smooth per-frame deltas.
- `stemAnalyzer_sameWindow_producesStableFeatures` — convergence on repeated identical input.
- `stemAnalyzer_zeroLengthWindow_returnsZeroFeatures` — safety under empty input.

Verified: 3/3 new tests pass; full suite 308/314 with only pre-existing environmental failures (Apple Music not running × 4, perf flake, network timeout).

### Increment 3.5.5 — Arachne Preset (bioluminescent spider webs) ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21

Bioluminescent spider web visualizer using the M3+ mesh shader pipeline with vertex fallback for M1/M2. Key decisions and implementation:

- **`ArachneState.swift`** — 12-web pool with beat-measured stage lifecycle (anchorPulse → radial → spiral → stable → evicting). Drum-driven spawn accumulator (`drumsOnsetRate × dt × stemMix`). LCG PRNG seeded per-web for deterministic layout. GPU `webBuffer` (MTLBuffer, 12 × 64 bytes) flushed after every tick. 2 pre-seeded stable webs satisfy D-037 inv.1 and inv.4 from frame zero.
- **`Arachne.metal`** — Object shader dispatches 12 mesh threadgroups (one per web slot). 64-thread mesh shader: thread 0 = hub cap, threads 1–8 = anchor dots, threads 9–16 = radial spokes, threads 17–56 = spiral segments. Inactive threads write off-screen geometry. Dead webs: `set_primitive_count(0)`. Fragment shader: D-019 stemMix warmup, bass-driven strand quiver, MV-3b beat anticipation.
- **`PresetCategory.organic`** added — keeps Arachne separate from abstract/geometric families in Orchestrator family-repeat scoring. D-038 in DECISIONS.md.
- **`ArachneStateTests.swift`** — 8 unit tests covering all 8 pool-management invariants from D-037.

**Visual tuning (post-session 2026-04-21T13-26-38Z):** First playback revealed three issues: (1) hub throb used `sin(time * 9)` — continuous free-running oscillation with no music connection; (2) strand quiver scrolled at fixed `time * 4.8` rate, never syncing to beats; (3) bioluminescent effect weak — sat=0.72 and linear glow falloff. Fixes: (1) hub throb during anchorPulse replaced with `anticipation * 0.9` (beat_phase01-driven only); (2) quiver wave phase-locked to beat via `sin(dist*12 - beat_phase01*2π)` so one wave propagates per beat; (3) sat raised to 0.92, glow changed to `exp2(-dist*3)` exponential falloff with darker base (0.20) and brighter hub (0.85). **Rule: never use free-running `sin(time)` for motion in organic presets — all oscillation should be beat-anchored or at minimum audio-amplitude-gated.**

**Verification:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` → 427 tests pass; `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp` → BUILD SUCCEEDED; SwiftLint → 0 violations in active sources.

### Increment 3.5.6 — Gossamer Preset (bioluminescent sonic resonator) ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21

Bioluminescent hero-web as a musical resonator. A single SDF-drawn static web (12 radials + Archimedean capture spiral) acts as the "instrument body"; up to 32 vocal-pitch-keyed propagating color waves travel outward from the hub along all radials simultaneously, leaving decaying echoes via mv_warp temporal feedback.

- **`GossamerState.swift`** — 32-wave pool. Each `Wave` has birthTime, hue (baked from YIN pitch), saturation (baked from other-stem density), amplitude (baked from vocals_energy_dev). Emission gates on `vocalsPitchConfidence > 0.35 OR |vocalsEnergyDev| > 0.05`; below threshold, accumulator integrates but no wave is emitted. Ambient drift floor guarantees waveCount ≥ 2 at silence. Retirement when `age > maxWaveLifetime = 6s`. GPU buffer (528 bytes): GossamerGPU header + 32 WaveGPU (16 bytes each). Bound at `fragment buffer(6)` via `pipeline.setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer` / `directPresetFragmentBuffer` in RenderPipeline.
- **`Gossamer.metal`** — SDF scene (radial spokes + Archimedean spiral strand) drawn at each fragment; color waves sampled as a ring-pass at `|dist - waveRadius| < waveWidth`. mv_warp pass accumulates decaying echoes (decay=0.955). D-026 deviation-first; D-019 warmup; D-037 acceptance satisfied via background gradient + seeded waves.
- **`GossamerStateTests.swift`** — 8 unit tests: initial pool, emission rate, confidence gate, FV fallback, retirement, silence stability, pool eviction, determinism.

**Verification:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` → 435 tests pass; `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp` → BUILD SUCCEEDED.

### Increment 3.5.7 — Stalker Preset — **Retired** ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21 | **Retired:** 2026-04-21

Stalker was the original third entry in the Arachnid Trilogy: a black silhouette spider crossing a background web with a realistic alternating-tetrapod gait, triggered to a listening pose by sustained low-attack-ratio bass. After seeing all three trilogy presets in the session, the design was revised: the static-web-with-traversing-spider pattern created dead time (nothing interesting while the spider is offscreen) and the 2D mesh silhouette lacked the visual fidelity the preset deserved. The gait solver, sustained-bass discriminator, and GPU buffer architecture were retained as engineering foundations; the spider will be reborn as a 3D ray-march SDF easter egg triggered inside Arachne (see Increment 3.5.8).

**Removed files:** `Stalker/StalkerGait.swift`, `Stalker/StalkerState.swift`, `Stalker/StalkerState+GPU.swift`, `Shaders/Stalker.metal`, `Shaders/Stalker.json`, `StalkerGaitTests.swift`, `StalkerStateTests.swift`. All `stalkerState` references removed from `VisualizerEngine.swift` and `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`.

**Post-retirement:** 440 tests pass; BUILD SUCCEEDED; 0 SwiftLint violations.

### Increment 3.5.8 — Arachne + Gossamer visual rework ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21

Post-session visual feedback on all three Arachnid Trilogy presets surfaced actionable changes to Arachne and Gossamer. No logic regressions; 440 tests pass before and after.

**Arachne changes:**
- **Stage pacing slowed 3×**: `radialDuration` → `Float(anchorCount) × 2.0` beats (10–16 beats), `spiralDuration` → `max(20.0, revolutions × 2.5)` (≥20 beats). At 120 BPM a full build now takes ≥18s. `evictingDuration` extended to 4 beats.
- **Per-web golden-ratio hue**: `birthHue = fract(Float(slot) × 0.618 + centroidJitter)`. 12 web slots distribute across the hue wheel with no repetition (Fibonacci dispersion).
- **Anchor dots removed**: threads 1–8 in the mesh shader always write offscreen. Anchors remain as spoke endpoints.
- **2-layer bioluminescent glow**: fragment replaced smooth-step cross-section profile with `exp(-d²×22)` core + `exp(-d²×3.8)` halo. Hub-fade term `exp(-dist²×3.5)` brightens strand bases. Hub cap uses circular gaussian instead of hard smoothstep.
- **Saturation locked high**: `birthSat = 0.88 + lcg * 0.10` (vs centroid-derived). Seeded webs use slot-0/1 golden-ratio hues at sat=0.92.

**Gossamer changes:**
- **Gaussian wave rings**: `exp(-(dr²) / (sigma²))` with sigma=0.011 UV. Eliminates hard-edge "block" artifacts from the previous `smoothstep(thickness, 0.0, dr)`.
- **Web breathing**: radials brighten with `max(0, bassRel) × 0.65`, spiral with `max(0, mid_att_rel) × 0.50`. Blend weight from per-pixel `radCov / (radCov + spirCov)`.
- **2-layer strand halos**: Gaussian halo terms `exp(-rDist²/0.0055²)` and `exp(-sDist²/0.0045²)` add visible luminous aura around each strand.
- **Complementary color pairs**: each wave also contributes `hsv2rgb(hue + 0.5, sat × 0.45, amp × 0.30)` for iridescent shimmer at wave edges.
- **Interference blooms**: `saturate(totalRingWeight - 1.0) × 0.45 × strandCov` adds warm-white burst where ≥2 waves overlap.
- **Reduced mv_warp decay**: `0.955 → 0.90` (shorter trails, sharper visual impact per wave). JSON sidecar updated.
- **Saturation floor raised**: `emitWave` saturation floor `0.5 → 0.85`; drift waves `0.60 → 0.90`; seeded waves `0.70/0.65 → 0.92/0.90`.

### Increment 3.5.9 — Spider easter egg in Arachne ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21

**Scope:** Add a 3D ray-march SDF spider that appears as a rare easter egg inside the Arachne mesh-shader preset. Frequency target: ~1-in-10 songs. Trigger: sustained sub-bass (`subBass > 0.65`, `bassAttackRatio < 0.55`, held ≥ 0.75 s) + session-level cooldown (≥5 min between appearances). Calibration track: James Blake "Limit to Your Love" — prominent sub-bass drop after the chorus.

**Design:**
- Spider materialises on the web — positioned at the hub, limbs following radials in rest pose.
- Fragment: ray-march SDF through the Arachne fragment shader (invoked when the spider is active via `spiderBlend > 0`). The spider SDF runs as an overlay pass in the mesh shader fragment.
- Body: smooth-union ellipsoids — cephalothorax (major 0.06, minor 0.045), abdomen (major 0.08, minor 0.055), pedipalps (2 small spheres).
- Legs: 8 × 3-joint tapered capsule chain. Hip joint at radial anchor positions; intermediate joints at ~0.55× full length; tip near spiral perimeter. Radius tapers 0.008 (hip) → 0.002 (tip).
- Material: dark chitinous exoskeleton. Base albedo 0.015 (near-black). Clearcoat 0.85, roughness 0.08 for dramatic specular. Thin-film iridescence: `sin(normalDot × 12) × 0.15` shifts surface hue in cyan/violet band.
- Lighting: lit primarily by the web's bioluminescent emission (nearest radials and spiral segments as area lights approximated by nearest `radCov`/`spirCov` values already computed in the fragment).
- Animation: gait solver computed in `ArachneState.tick()` — same alternating-tetrapod math as the original GaitSolver but embedded in `ArachneState` (no separate file). State: `spiderBlend` (0 = absent, 1 = fully materialized), `spiderPos` (hub-relative UV), `spiderHeading`, `gaitPhase`.
- GPU: extend `WebGPU` to include 1 extra `float4 × 12` block (spider body + 8 leg tip positions), OR add a separate `ArachneSpiderGPU` buffer at `object/mesh buffer(2)`. The latter is cleaner; the fragment will need to receive it via a separate binding.
- Fade: spider materialises over ~2 s via `spiderBlend` easing. Dematerialises after sustained-bass condition ends (same asymmetric decay as original StalkerState accumulator).

**Files to touch:** `ArachneState.swift` (gait solver + spider state + sub-bass trigger), `Arachne.metal` (spider SDF + fragment overlay), `ArachneStateTests.swift` (4 new tests: trigger fires on sustained sub-bass, does NOT fire on kick, spider dematerialises, cooldown gate).

### Increment 3.5.10 — Arachne ray march remaster ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-22

**Scope:** Replace Arachne's mesh-shader preset with a full 3D SDF ray-marched scene. The mesh-shader implementation used free-running `sin(time)` oscillators that made motion feel mechanical and disconnected from audio (failed approach #33, session 2026-04-21T13-26-38Z). The ray-march approach gives correct 3D perspective, unique per-web tilt, beat-phase-locked vibration, and proper temporal accumulation via mv_warp.

**Architecture changes:**
- `Arachne.json`: passes changed from `["mesh_shader"]` to `["mv_warp"]`. Preset is now a direct fragment shader + mv_warp, not a mesh shader.
- `Arachne.metal`: complete rewrite as 3D SDF ray march. 64-step march; perspective camera 60° FOV at z=−1.8 (close enough for dramatic web scale). Each web is a tilted disc of SDF tubes; tilt derived from `rng_seed` field (±14% X, ±10% Y before normalisation). Pool webs at `hub_xy × {0.9, 0.8}` spread, depth mapped z∈[−0.4, 1.4]. Permanent anchor web at `(0, 0, 0.2)` (D-037). Spider SDF from Increment 3.5.9 always placed at anchor position; fixes Z-depth mismatch of the old mesh-shader approach. `sdWebElement` draws hub cap + progressive radials (alternating-pair order, ±22% angular jitter per spoke) + Archimedean spiral with corrected SDF (`min(fract, 1−fract)` — `abs(fract−0.5)` was inverted, rendering filled sectors instead of strands). Tube radius 0.012 world units ≈ 11 px at 1080p. Soft bioluminescent glow `exp2(−minWebDist × 14)` for miss rays ensures D-037 formComplexity at any resolution. mv_warp decay=0.92.
- `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`: Arachne setup moved from `.meshShader` case to `.mvWarp` case. Buffer(6) = web pool, buffer(7) = spider GPU.
- `RenderPipeline.swift` + `RenderPipeline+PresetSwitching.swift` + `RenderPipeline+MVWarp.swift`: added `directPresetFragmentBuffer2` (buffer(7)) infrastructure.
- `PresetAcceptanceTests.swift`: buffer(7) bound (zeroed) so spider `blend=0` during tests.
- `PresetRegressionTests.swift`: Arachne golden hash regenerated.

**D-041** in DECISIONS.md.

444 tests pass; 0 SwiftLint violations.

### Increment 3.5.11 — Gossamer SDF correction + v3 acceptance gate ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-22

**Problem 1 — Inverted SDF in spiral and hub-ring distance functions.** `gossamerSpiralDist` and `gossamerHubDist` both used `abs(fract(x) − 0.5)` as their fold formula. This gives 0 in the GAPS between threads and 0.5 ON the threads — the opposite of what a distance function requires. The result: the entire capture zone rendered as a uniformly lit filled disc (the SDF gave zero distance everywhere off-thread, fully covering everything via the coverage and halo terms). Fixed to `min(fract(x), 1 − fract(x))` which correctly gives 0 ON the thread.

**Problem 2 — D-037 acceptance invariant 3 failure (beat response bounded).** The inverted SDF caused silence and steady-energy renders to look identical (both uniformly lit at `0.55 × baseColor`). `meanSquaredDiff(silence, steady) = 0` while `meanSquaredDiff(steady, beat-heavy) = 151` — the beat flash was seen as an overreaction relative to zero continuous motion. Fixed in two parts: (a) `brightness = 0.12 + f.bass × 0.76 + bassRel × 0.12` — absolute `f.bass` creates a music-presence glow so silence (f.bass=0) is dim and steady music (f.bass≈0.5) is lit; (b) `beatFlash` reduced from 0.65 to 0.30 to keep beat accent proportional to the continuous baseline.

**Geometry changes (v3):** 17 explicitly-defined irregular spoke angles replacing formula-derived equal spacing. Off-center hub at (0.465, 0.32). Elliptical stretch removed. `kWebRadius` expanded 0.42→0.44. See D-042.

444 tests pass; 0 SwiftLint violations. Golden hashes regenerated for Gossamer and Arachne.

### Increment MV-0 — Drop v4.2 stash, re-land sky-tint conditional ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-16, commit `91f698d5`

Dropped the v4.2 git stash. Re-applied the `RayMarch.metal:208` sky-tint conditional: miss/sky pixels now multiply by `scene.lightColor.rgb` only when `sceneParamsB.y > 1e5` (fog-disabled sentinel). This restores cool-sky/warm-light contrast on Glass Brutalist and Kinetic Sculpture while preserving VolumetricLithograph's warm sky tint when `scene_fog: 0`.

All preset-pipeline regression tests passing.

### Increment MV-1 — Milkdrop-correct audio primitives ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-16, commit `a05fd753`

`FeatureVector` expanded 32→48 floats (128→192 bytes). Nine new deviation fields derived each frame in `MIRPipeline.buildFeatureVector()`:
- `bassRel/Dev`, `midRel/Dev`, `trebRel/Dev` — centered deviation from AGC midpoint.
- `bassAttRel`, `midAttRel`, `trebAttRel` — smoothed deviation for continuous motion drivers.

`StemFeatures` expanded 16→32 floats (64→128 bytes). Eight new stem deviation fields derived in `StemAnalyzer.analyze()` via per-stem EMA (decay 0.995):
- `{vocals,drums,bass,other}EnergyRel/Dev`.

Metal preamble structs in `PresetLoader+Preamble.swift` updated to match. `VolumetricLithograph.metal` converted to deviation-based drivers as reference implementation. All other presets grandfathered. `RelDevTests.swift` (4 contract tests) gates the invariants. CLAUDE.md documents the authoring convention.

**CHECKPOINT outcome:** deviation primitives alone did not converge VL on "feels musical" — confirmed the architectural gap (missing per-vertex feedback warp) is the critical path. MV-2 proceeded as planned.

### Increment MV-2 — Per-vertex feedback warp mesh ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-17, commit `c8cd558f`

New `mv_warp` render pass implementing Milkdrop-style 32×24 per-vertex feedback warp. Any preset opts in via `"mv_warp"` in its `passes` JSON array.

**Architecture:** Three passes per frame:
1. **Warp pass** — 32×24 vertex grid (4278 vertices). Each vertex calls preset-authored `mvWarpPerFrame()` + `mvWarpPerVertex()`. Fragment samples `warpTexture` (previous frame) at displaced UV × `pf.decay` → `composeTexture`.
2. **Compose pass** — fullscreen quad. Alpha-blends `sceneTexture` (current scene) onto `composeTexture` with `alpha = (1 - decay)`.
3. **Blit pass** — `composeTexture` → drawable. Swap warp ↔ compose for next frame.

**Key implementation details:**
- `MVWarpPipelineBundle` (public struct) holds 3 `MTLRenderPipelineState` + `pixelFormat`. Created in `applyPreset` from `PresetLoader`-compiled states.
- `MVWarpState` marked `@unchecked Sendable` because `MTLTexture` protocol is not `Sendable` in Swift 6.0.
- `SceneUniforms` is forward-declared in `mvWarpPreamble` behind `#ifndef SCENE_UNIFORMS_DEFINED` so direct (non-ray-march) presets compile without the ray-march preamble. Ray-march preamble wraps its own definition in the same guard to prevent redefinition.
- Ray-march + mv_warp handoff: `.rayMarch` renders to offscreen `warpState.sceneTexture` when `.mvWarp` is also in `activePasses`; `.mvWarp` handles drawable presentation.
- Initial texture allocation uses 1920×1080; `reallocateMVWarpTextures` fires from `drawableSizeWillChange` with actual drawable size before first frame.

**Presets converted:**
- `VolumetricLithograph` — `passes: ["ray_march", "post_process", "mv_warp"]`. Melody-driven zoom breath (`mid_att_rel × 0.003`), valence rotation, decay=0.96, terrain-coherent UV ripple from bass (horizontal) and melody (vertical) at 0.004 UV amplitude.
- `Starburst (Murmuration)` — `passes: ["mv_warp"]` (replaced `["feedback", "particles"]`). Bass breath zoom, melody rotation, decay=0.97 for long cloud smear.

**Tests:** `MVWarpPipelineTests.swift` — identity warp test (seed red, assert output stays red) and accumulation test (10 frames with blue scene, assert red decays measurably).

### Increment D-030 — SpectralHistoryBuffer + SpectralCartograph ✅

New `SpectralHistoryBuffer` class (Shared module): 16 KB UMA MTLBuffer at fragment buffer index 5, bound unconditionally in all direct-pass fragment encoders. Maintains 5 ring buffers of 480 samples (≈8s at 60fps): valence, arousal, beat_phase01, bass_dev, and log-normalized vocal pitch. Updated once per frame in `RenderPipeline.draw(in:)`; reset on track change via `VisualizerEngine.resetStemPipeline(for:)`.

`SpectralCartograph` preset: first `instrument`-family preset. Four-panel real-time MIR diagnostic — TL=FFT spectrum (log-frequency, centroid-driven colour), TR=3-band deviation meters (D-026 compliant: reads only `*_att_rel` and `*_dev`), BL=valence/arousal phase plot with 8-second fading trail, BR=scrolling line graphs for `beat_phase01`, `bass_dev`, and `vocals_pitch_norm`. Direct pass only.

CLAUDE.md GPU Contract corrected: buffer(0)=FeatureVector (not FFT as previously documented). buffer(4)=SceneUniforms (ray march only, not future use). buffer(5)=SpectralHistory.

New `PresetCategory.instrument` case added.

15+ new tests across `SpectralHistoryBufferTests.swift`, `SpectralCartographTests.swift`, and additions to `RenderPipelineTests.swift`.

---

### Increment D-030b — Verification fixes + InputLevelMonitor ✅

Post-D-030 live-session verification (2026-04-20) found and fixed four issues:

**BeatPredictor timing bug (critical).** `beatPhase01` was always 0 in production. Root cause: `MIRPipeline.processAnalysisFrame` calls `mir.process(... time: 0 ...)` on every frame; `BeatPredictor.update()` accumulated timing via the `time` parameter, so `now = 0` always. First onset set `lastBeatTime = 0`; the subsequent `if lastBeatTime > 0` guard was false for `0.0`, so `hasPeriod` never became true. Fixed by internal `elapsedTime` accumulation from `deltaTime` (independent of `time`); guards changed `> 0` → `>= 0`. The `BeatPredictorTests.swift` bootstrap test was also updated to advance time frame-by-frame rather than via a single `time` jump (single calls only advance by one `dt` with the new accumulator).

**SpectralCartograph silent load.** The preset JSON was missing `"fragment_function": "spectral_cartograph_fragment"`. `PresetLoader` defaulted to `"preset_fragment"` which doesn't exist in the library, causing the preset to be silently skipped at load time.

**Swift 6 @MainActor warnings.** `MTKView.currentDrawable`, `currentRenderPassDescriptor`, and `drawableSize` are `@MainActor`-isolated; accessing them from nonisolated `draw(in:)` and helper methods produced ~18 Xcode IDE warnings. Fixed by annotating `draw(in:)`, `renderFrame`, `drawDirect`, `drawWithFeedback`, `drawParticleMode`, `drawSurfaceMode`, `drawWithICB`, `drawWithMeshShader`, `drawWithMVWarp`, `drawWithPostProcess`, `drawWithRayMarch` as `@MainActor`. The `@preconcurrency import MetalKit` already in each file suppresses any conformance mismatch for the protocol requirement.

**InputLevelMonitor** (new component). A live session (2026-04-17T19-31-46Z) routed through a Multi-Output Device (BlackHole + Mac mini Speakers) produced peaks at −20 dBFS with treble fraction at 0.1% — undetectable by the existing `SilenceDetector` (which only distinguishes silent/non-silent) or by post-AGC feature values (which normalise away absolute level). `InputLevelMonitor` measures peak dBFS (21s rolling window via `vDSP_maxmgv`) and 3-band spectral balance (EMAs on squared FFT magnitudes). Classification is peak-only after session 2026-04-17T21-05-47Z showed treble-ratio thresholds produced false positives on bass-heavy tracks (Oxytocin: 0.2% treble, clean chain). 30-frame hysteresis prevents log flapping. Quality transitions logged to session.log via `VisualizerEngine+Audio`; displayed in DebugOverlay.

Also: `MusicKitBridge` unused `artistLower` removed; `SessionRecorder` `_ = try? fh.seekToEnd()` to suppress unused `UInt64?` result.

343 tests, 5 pre-existing Apple Music failures. All 3 `BeatPredictorTests` now pass with correct phase tracking.

## Immediate Next Increments

These are ordered by dependency. Each has done-when criteria and verification commands.

**Current priority ordering (post-2026-04-22 documentation audit):**

1. **Phase U — UX Architecture** (U.1 → U.7 gates Milestone A). Sequential.
2. **Phase V — Visual Fidelity Uplift** (V.1 → V.6 build the library; V.7 → V.12 apply it). V.1–V.6 can run in parallel with Phase U since they touch disjoint modules. V.7+ starts once V.1–V.3 utilities land.
3. **Phase MD — Milkdrop Ingestion** (MD.1 → MD.7). Starts once Phase V.1–V.3 utilities land. Parallelizable with V.7+.
4. **Phase 6** (Progressive readiness, Frame budget manager, ML dispatch scheduling). 6.1 specifically unblocks the "Start now" CTA in Increment U.4 — either pull 6.1 forward or ship U.4 with the CTA dormant.
5. **Phase 7** (Long-session stability). Unchanged.

Phase MV is complete; see below for its historical record.

## Phase MV — Milkdrop-Informed Musical Architecture

**Why this phase exists:** six iterations on Volumetric Lithograph produced incremental fixes but never converged on "feels like a band member playing along with the music." [`docs/MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE.md`](MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE.md) documents the research that identified the root cause:

1. Milkdrop's audio vocabulary is **identical in scope to what Phosphene already computes** — no chord recognition, no pitch tracking, no stems. Our analysis pipeline is richer than theirs.
2. Milkdrop's `bass`/`bass_att` are **AGC-normalized ratios centered at 1.0**. Phosphene's are centered at 0.5 via the same AGC mechanism. But our presets have been authored with absolute thresholds — the wrong primitive for an AGC signal. Absolute thresholds inherently fail across tracks because the AGC divisor moves with mix density.
3. Milkdrop's "musical feel" comes from its **per-vertex feedback warp architecture**, not its audio analysis. Every preset warps the previous frame via a 32×24 grid, and motion *accumulates* over many frames. Simple audio inputs compound into rich organic motion.
4. **9 of 11 Phosphene presets did not use any feedback loop** prior to MV-2 — they rendered from scratch each frame. Ray-march presets in particular showed only instantaneous audio state. This is why they felt "disconnected" from music regardless of how cleverly tuned.

MV-0 ✅, MV-1 ✅, MV-2 ✅, MV-3 ✅ complete.

### Increment MV-3 — Beyond-Milkdrop extensions ✅

**MV-3a — Richer per-stem metadata** ✅
- `StemFeatures` expanded 32→64 floats (128→256 bytes). New per-stem fields: `{vocals,drums,bass,other}{OnsetRate, Centroid, AttackRatio, EnergySlope}` (floats 25–40), computed in `StemAnalyzer.analyze()` via `computeRichFeatures()`.
- `StemAnalyzerMV3Tests.swift`: click vs sine distinguishes attackRatio; silence gives zeros; 120-BPM click track mean onsetRate in [1.0, 3.5]/sec.

**MV-3b — Next-beat phase predictor** ✅
- New `BeatPredictor` class (IIR period estimation from onset rising edges). Feeds `beatPhase01` and `beatsUntilNext` into `FeatureVector` floats 35–36. Integrated in `MIRPipeline.buildFeatureVector()`.
- `BeatPredictorTests.swift`: phase monotonically rises 0→1; phase resets after 3× period silence; bootstrap BPM gives correct phase.
- `VolumetricLithograph.metal` updated: `approachFrac = max(0, (f.beat_phase01 - 0.80) / 0.20)` pre-beat anticipatory zoom.

**MV-3c — Vocal pitch tracking** ✅
- New `PitchTracker` (YIN autocorrelation, vDSP_dotpr). Key fix: advance to local CMNDF minimum before parabolic interpolation (finding just the first sub-threshold point causes catastrophic extrapolation on the descending slope). 80–1000 Hz gate, 0.6 confidence threshold, EMA decay 0.8.
- Feeds `vocalsPitchHz` and `vocalsPitchConfidence` into `StemFeatures` floats 41–42.
- `PitchTrackerTests.swift`: 440 Hz and 220 Hz within 5 cents; silence → 0 Hz; random noise → unvoiced.
- `VolumetricLithograph.metal` updated: `vl_pitchHueShift()` maps pitch to ±0.15 palette phase shift; gated by confidence ≥ 0.6.

**Explicitly NOT part of MV-3 (still out of scope):**
- Basic Pitch port, chord recognition via Tonic, HTDemucs swap, Sound Analysis framework

---

## Phase 4 — Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is the product's key differentiator. It is implemented as an explicit scoring and policy system, not a black box.

### Increment 4.0 — Enriched Preset Metadata Schema ✅

**Scope:** `PresetMetadata.swift` (new), `PresetDescriptor.swift` (extended), all 11 JSON sidecars back-filled.

Pulled forward from Phase 5.1 because Increment 4.1 (PresetScorer) cannot be built without the metadata it scores on. Adding the schema now eliminates a breaking change immediately after 4.1 is drafted.

**New types:** `FatigueRisk`, `TransitionAffordance`, `SongSection` (String-raw, Codable, Sendable, Hashable, CaseIterable). `ComplexityCost` struct with dual-form Codable (scalar or `{"tier1":x,"tier2":y}`). All in `PresetMetadata.swift`.

**New `PresetDescriptor` fields (all optional in JSON, fallback-on-missing, warn-on-malformed):**
`visual_density`, `motion_intensity`, `color_temperature_range`, `fatigue_risk`, `transition_affordances`, `section_suitability`, `complexity_cost`.

**Done when:** ✅ All criteria met.
- `PresetMetadata.swift` with three enums and `ComplexityCost`, all correct Swift 6 types.
- `PresetDescriptor` has 7 new fields; decoding falls back to defaults; unknown `fatigue_risk` logs warning + uses `.medium`.
- All 11 built-in preset JSON sidecars have explicit values for all 7 new fields.
- `PresetLoaderBuiltInPresetsHaveValidPipelines` regression gate still passes.
- `PresetDescriptorMetadataTests`: round-trip, defaults, malformed, complexity variants (scalar + nested), on-disk back-fill regression (6 test functions).
- D-029 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. CLAUDE.md preset metadata table extended.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetDescriptorMetadataTests`

---

### Increment L-1 — Structural SwiftLint Cleanup

**Scope:** Refactor 12 source files to eliminate all 24 remaining structural SwiftLint violations. No logic changes — pure mechanical refactoring. Verified by `swiftlint lint --strict` reporting 0 violations on active source paths, with all tests still passing.

**Background:** After the 2026-04-20 auto-fix pass, 24 structural violations remain (down from 166). These are `file_length`, `function_body_length`, `cyclomatic_complexity`, `type_body_length`, `large_tuple`, and `line_length` — rules that require file splits or helper extraction rather than auto-correction.

**Violations and fix strategy (file:line:rule):**

- New files added to the same target as the file being split (no new SPM targets).
- When splitting a file, all `// MARK: -` dividers from the original stay with their section.
- `StemRichFeatures` replacing the named tuple: must update all call sites in `StemAnalyzer.swift`; no other files reference the tuple directly.
- All existing tests must pass before and after each file change.

**Done when:**
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml PhospheneEngine/Sources/ PhospheneEngine/Tests/ PhospheneApp/` reports **0 violations**.
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` passes (all tests green).
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build` succeeds with 0 errors.

### Increment 4.1 — Preset Scoring Model ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20.

`DefaultPresetScorer` implements the `PresetScoring` protocol with four weighted sub-scores (mood 0.30, stemAffinity 0.25, sectionSuitability 0.25, tempoMotion 0.20) and two multiplicative penalties (family-repeat 0.2×, smoothstep fatigue cooldown 60/120/300s). Hard exclusions gate perf-budget breakers and identity matches before scoring. `PresetScoreBreakdown` exposes every sub-score for introspection. `PresetScoringContext` is a fully Sendable value-type snapshot with a monotonic session clock — no `Date.now()` inside the scorer. 13 unit tests cover all contract edges including determinism, exclusion, cooldown, and rank stability across device tiers. See D-032 in DECISIONS.md for weight rationale.

**New files:** `Orchestrator/PresetScorer.swift`, `Orchestrator/PresetScoringContext.swift`, `Shared/DeviceTier.swift`. Extended: `PresetDescriptor` (added `stemAffinity: [String: String]`), `ComplexityCost` (added `cost(for:)` helper), `Package.swift` (added `Session` dep to `Orchestrator` target, `Orchestrator` dep to test target).

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetScorerTests`

---

### Increment 4.2 — Transition Policy ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20.

`DefaultTransitionPolicy` implements the `TransitionDeciding` protocol. Priority: structural boundary (when `StructuralPrediction.confidence ≥ 0.5` and boundary within 2.5 s lookahead window) beats duration-expired timer fallback. `TransitionDecision` is fully inspectable: trigger, scheduledAt, style (crossfade/cut/morph), duration, confidence, rationale. Style negotiated from `currentPreset.transitionAffordances` and energy level — high energy (> 0.7) prefers `.cut`, low energy prefers `.crossfade`. Crossfade duration scales linearly from 2.0 s (energy=0) to 0.5 s (energy=1). Family-repeat avoidance is already handled upstream by `DefaultPresetScorer` (familyRepeatMultiplier=0.2×). 12 unit tests with synthetic `StructuralPrediction` inputs — all pass. See D-033 in DECISIONS.md.

**New files:** `Orchestrator/TransitionPolicy.swift`, `Tests/Orchestrator/TransitionPolicyTests.swift`.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine`

---

### Increment 4.3 — Session Planner ✅

**Scope:** `Orchestrator/SessionPlanner.swift`, `Orchestrator/PlannedSession.swift`. Greedy forward-walk planner composing `DefaultPresetScorer` + `DefaultTransitionPolicy`. Produces a `PlannedSession` — ordered list of `PlannedTrack` entries each carrying the selected `PresetDescriptor`, `PresetScoreBreakdown`, `PlannedTransition`, and planned timing. `planAsync` accepts a precompile closure (caller-injected, keeps Orchestrator module free of Renderer dependency). Deterministic: same inputs → byte-identical output. `PlanningWarning` surfaces degradation events. SessionManager integration deferred: `Session` module cannot import `Orchestrator` without a circular dependency — app-layer wiring is Increment 4.5.

**Landed 2026-04-20.** 13 unit tests covering empty-playlist/empty-catalog errors, single-track plan, 5-track family diversity, tier exclusion, mood arc, fatigue, full-exclusion fallback, determinism, `track(at:)` / `transition(at:)` lookups, precompile dedup, and precompile failure handling. D-034 in DECISIONS.md. 387 tests total; 4 pre-existing Apple Music env failures unchanged.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter SessionPlannerTests`

### Increment 4.4 — Golden Session Test Fixtures ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20.

`GoldenSessionTests.swift` — 12 regression tests across three curated playlists that lock in the expected Orchestrator output for any given set of track profiles and the full 11-preset production catalog. Any future change to `DefaultPresetScorer`, `DefaultTransitionPolicy`, `DefaultSessionPlanner`, or a preset JSON sidecar that breaks a golden test is a regression; the test file must be updated with a scoring trace comment that proves the new expected values are correct.

**Session A (high-energy electronic, 5 × 180 s, BPM=130, val=0.7, arous=0.8):** VL→Plasma→VL→FO→VL. Transitions from VL are cuts (VL carries `[crossfade, cut]` affordances, energy=0.82 > 0.7 threshold); transitions from Plasma/FO are crossfades at ~0.77 s.

**Session B (mellow jazz, 5 × 180 s, BPM=85, val=0.3, arous=−0.3):** VL→GB→VL→GB→VL. All crossfades at ~1.43 s (energy=0.38). No high-motion preset (Murmuration motion=0.85) ever wins.

**Session C (genre-diverse, 6 tracks, varied durations):** VL→GB→VL→Plasma→VL→FO. Covers 4 families (fluid, geometric, hypnotic, abstract).

**Key implementation decisions:**
- `allBreakdowns: [(PresetDescriptor, PresetScoreBreakdown)]` was **not** added to `PlannedTrack`. Runner-up inspection is done by calling `DefaultPresetScorer().breakdown(preset:track:context:)` directly inside the test body — no new public API.
- `PlannedTransition` carries no `trigger` enum field; trigger type is verified via `reason.hasPrefix("Structural boundary")`.
- Two pre-implementation spec derivation errors were caught and corrected against the code: Plasma (0.803) beats Ferrofluid Ocean (0.793) in high-energy electronic sessions because Plasma's tempCenter (0.6) is closer to targetTemp (0.78). The spec's scoring trace omitted Plasma when listing non-fluid competitors.

399 tests total; 4 pre-existing Apple Music env failures unchanged.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter GoldenSessionTests`

### Increment 4.5 — Live Adaptation ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20.

`LiveAdapter.swift` + `LiveAdapter+Patching.swift` + `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift`. `DefaultLiveAdapter` implementing `LiveAdapting` protocol with two adaptation paths (boundary reschedule > mood override). `PlannedSession.applying(_:at:)` extension for controlled plan mutation from the app layer. `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator` holds `livePlan` (NSLock-guarded) and provides `buildPlan()`, `currentPreset(at:)`, `currentTransition(at:)`, `applyLiveUpdate(...)`.

**Boundary reschedule:** fires when `StructuralPrediction.confidence ≥ 0.5` AND the live boundary deviates from the planned transition time by > 5 s. 5 s = 2× the `LookaheadBuffer` 2.5 s window — deviations smaller than that are within normal preview-vs-live jitter. Wins over mood override when both conditions fire simultaneously.

**Mood override:** fires only when all three hold: `|Δvalence| > 0.4 || |Δarousal| > 0.4`, elapsed fraction < 40%, and the best-scoring alternative preset is > 0.15 higher. Current preset scored without exclusion (true live score); alternatives scored with current preset excluded. Cap at 40% prevents churn in the back half of a track.

**Key implementation decisions (D-035):**
- `LiveAdaptation.PresetOverride` is a nested struct (not a named tuple) for `Sendable` conformance in Swift 6 strict mode.
- `PlannedSession.applying` lives in `LiveAdapter+Patching.swift` (same Orchestrator module as the internal memberwise inits of `PlannedSession`/`PlannedTrack`) — the only controlled mutation path outside of `DefaultSessionPlanner.plan()`.
- Empty `recentHistory: []` in live scoring context is intentional — fatigueMultiplier is a session-level pre-plan concern; live overrides that fire mid-track should not re-apply session-level fatigue logic.
- `LiveAdapting` protocol uses `// swiftlint:disable function_parameter_count` (6 params) — wrapping into a context struct would add an intermediate allocation on the hot path with no modelling benefit.

**Test notes:**
- `noBoundarySignal()` helper (confidence=0.0) bypasses the boundary path in mood-only tests. Using `closeBoundary(at: N)` in mood tests caused unexpected boundary reschedules because the live session boundary deviated > 5 s from the planned transition time even when confidence was high.
- Override catalog uses `visual_density` JSON field (`case visualDensity = "visual_density"` in `PresetDescriptor.CodingKeys`) — confirmed before writing test helpers.
- Scoring math verified by hand: pre-analyzed sad/calm (-0.5, -0.5) → targetTemp=0.30; CurrentPreset (center=0.25, density=0.25) → mood score 0.95. Live happy/energetic (0.7, 0.7) → targetTemp=0.78; AltPreset (center=0.78, density=0.78) → mood score 1.0. Gap = 0.875 − 0.716 = 0.159 > 0.15 threshold.

407 tests total; 4 pre-existing Apple Music env failures unchanged.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter LiveAdapterTests`

### Increment 4.6 — Ad-Hoc Reactive Mode ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20

**What was built:**
- `ReactiveOrchestrator.swift` — `ReactiveAccumulationState` (listening/ramping/full), `ReactiveDecision`, `ReactiveOrchestrating` protocol, `DefaultReactiveOrchestrator` (stateless pure function). Confidence ramps 0→0.3 over first 15 s, 0.3→1.0 over 15–30 s, 1.0 after. Switch conditions: score gap > 0.20 OR structural boundary confidence ≥ 0.5.
- `ReactiveOrchestratorTests.swift` — 8 unit tests: listening hold, confidence ramp, ramping suggestion, score-gap suppression, boundary override, boundary scheduling, nil-preset path, empty-catalog hold.
- `VisualizerEngine.swift` — added `reactiveOrchestrator`, `reactiveSessionStart`, `lastReactiveSwitchTime`.
- `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift` — `applyLiveUpdate()` routes to `applyReactiveUpdate()` when `livePlan == nil`; `buildPlan()` clears `reactiveSessionStart` when a real plan arrives. 60 s cooldown prevents switch-thrashing.
- D-036 added to `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Key decisions:** D-036 — stateless orchestrator, app-layer owns cooldown and wall-clock elapsed time.

**Tests:** 407 → 415 (8 new). Same 4 pre-existing Apple Music environment failures.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter ReactiveOrchestratorTests`

## Phase 5 — Preset Certification Pipeline

### Increment 5.1 — Enriched Preset Metadata Schema ✅ (landed as Increment 4.0)

**Note:** This increment was pulled forward and completed as **Increment 4.0** because PresetScorer (Increment 4.1) requires this schema before it can be drafted. See Increment 4.0 above for the full done-when criteria and verification commands. All 5.1 scope items are complete.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine`

---

### Increment 5.2 — Preset Acceptance Checklist (Automated) ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-20

**What was built:**
- `PresetAcceptanceTests.swift` — 4 parametrized invariant tests across all production presets (44 test cases when bundle resources are linked):
  1. Non-black at silence (max channel > 10).
  2. No white clip on steady energy for non-HDR passes (max < 250).
  3. Beat response ≤ 2× continuous response + 1.0 tolerance (enforces CLAUDE.md audio data hierarchy).
  4. Form complexity ≥ 2 at silence (detects visually dead single-bin outputs).
- Four FeatureVector fixtures derived from AGC semantics and CLAUDE.md reference onset table (Love Rehab ~125 BPM, Miles Davis ~136 BPM). Not synthetic envelopes.
- `renderFrame` renders 64×64 offscreen via the preset's direct `pipelineState`. Ray march and post-process presets are rendered via their composite output; the `post_process` white-clip check is skipped (HDR values are legal before tone-mapping).
- `_acceptanceFixture` is a module-level constant loaded once; if bundle resources are absent, it returns `[]` (zero test cases rather than failure).

**Key decision:** D-037 — structural invariants over GPU output; perceptual snapshot regression deferred to 5.3.

**Tests:** 415 → 419 (4 new @Test functions; Swift Testing counts @Test declarations, not parametrized cases). Same 4 pre-existing Apple Music environment failures.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetAcceptanceTests`

---

### Increment 5.3 — Visual Regression Snapshots ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-21

**What was built:**
- `PresetRegressionTests.swift` — 3 parametrized regression tests (steady, beat-heavy, quiet) + 1 golden-generation utility test.
- 64-bit dHash computed via 9×8 luma grid + horizontal-difference encoding (`computeLumaGrid` + `dHash`).
- `goldenPresetHashes` dictionary: 11 preset entries × 3 fixtures = 33 comparisons. Fractal Tree excluded (meshShader).
- Hamming distance ≤ 8 tolerance (87.5% match). Missing entries skip silently (safe for new presets).
- `UPDATE_GOLDEN_SNAPSHOTS=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter test_printGoldenHashes` regenerates all values.
- Same buffer/skip infrastructure as Increment 5.2 (SceneUniforms for ray march, zeroed FFT/stems/history).
- `_acceptanceFixture` and `PresetFixtureContext` promoted from `private` to `internal` in `PresetAcceptanceTests.swift` so `PresetRegressionTests.swift` can reference them directly.

**Key decision:** D-039 — dHash regression gate; hardware caveat documented.

**Tests:** 435 → 439 (4 new @Test functions). Same pre-existing failures unchanged.

**Verify:**
```bash
swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetRegressionTests
# To regenerate goldens:
UPDATE_GOLDEN_SNAPSHOTS=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter test_printGoldenHashes
```

## Phase U — UX Architecture

**Why this phase exists:** the engine has a `SessionState` lifecycle (idle → connecting → preparing → ready → playing → ended) and a developer-facing debug overlay, but there is no user-facing UX specification and no corresponding UI. Phase 2.5 built the preparation *pipeline*; Phase U builds the UI around it. `docs/UX_SPEC.md` is the canonical spec for everything in this phase. Milestone A ("Trustworthy Playback Session") blocks on U.1–U.7.

### Increment U.1 — Session-state views ✅

**Scope:** `ContentView` becomes a pure switch on `SessionManager.state`. Six stub top-level views (`IdleView`, `ConnectingView`, `PreparationProgressView`, `ReadyView`, `PlaybackView`, `EndedView`) under `PhospheneApp/Views/`, each rendering a distinct testable hierarchy. `SessionStateViewModel` (`@MainActor ObservableObject`) observes `SessionManager` and publishes current state. New `CLAUDE.md §UX Contract` section. New `ARCHITECTURE.md §UI Layer` subsection.

**Done when:**
- ✅ Six views exist; each renders without errors for its corresponding state.
- ✅ `ContentView` contains no state logic beyond routing.
- ✅ Tests for each view — 9 tests across 3 suites in `PhospheneAppTests/SessionStateViewTests.swift`.
- ✅ Reduced-motion system flag detection stub in place (used by later increments).

**Implementation note:** Accessibility ID testing via SwiftUI's accessibility tree traversal is unreliable in unit tests — macOS only materialises the SwiftUI accessibility tree for active clients (VoiceOver, XCUITest). Each view exposes `static let accessibilityID: String`; `.accessibilityIdentifier(Self.accessibilityID)` binds it in the view body. Tests check the static constants; the binding is enforced by construction. See D-044.

**Verify:** `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' test` — 9 new tests pass.

---

### Increment U.2 — Permission onboarding ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-22

**What was built:**
- `PermissionMonitor` (`@MainActor ObservableObject`) observing
  `NSApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification`, backed by
  `ScreenCapturePermissionProviding`.
- `SystemScreenCapturePermissionProvider` (production) — `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess`.
  Never calls `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess` (system dialog doesn't compose with URL-scheme flow).
- `PhotosensitivityAcknowledgementStore` — injectable `UserDefaults` suite; key
  `phosphene.onboarding.photosensitivityAcknowledged`.
- `PermissionOnboardingView` per UX_SPEC §3.2; opens
  `x-apple.systempreferences:…?Privacy_ScreenCapture` via `NSWorkspace.shared.open`.
  No Retry button — return-detection is automatic via `PermissionMonitor`.
- `PhotosensitivityNoticeView` per UX_SPEC §3.3; surfaced as a `.sheet` on
  first `IdleView` appearance.
- `ContentView` refactored to two-level switch: permission gate above state switch.
  `PermissionMonitor` injected as `@EnvironmentObject` from `PhospheneApp`.
- `IdleView` updated with `.onAppear` + `.sheet(isPresented:)` for the notice.

**Key decisions:**
- Preflight + URL scheme, NOT `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()` — the request
  API's system dialog doesn't compose with "Open System Settings and return."
- Permission gate lives above the state switch, not inside `SessionStateViewModel` —
  permission routing outranks session state per UX_SPEC §3.1.
- Photosensitivity sheet on `IdleView`, not a separate top-level state — timing
  is "after permission, before first session" which maps exactly to `IdleView`'s
  first appearance.
- `PermissionMonitor` lives under `Permissions/`, not `Views/` — it is a
  routing-layer concern, not a view.

**Tests:** 535 → 549 (+14 new: 5 PermissionMonitor, 4 PhotosensitivityStore, 5 PermissionOnboarding). Pre-existing failures unchanged.

**Verify:**
- `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine`
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' test`
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml`

---

### Increment U.3 — Playlist connector picker ✅

**Landed:** 2026-04-23

**What was built:**
- `ConnectorType` enum (appleMusic/spotify/localFolder) with title/subtitle/systemImage.
- `ConnectorTileView`: reusable tile with enabled/disabled states and optional secondary
  action button.
- `ConnectorPickerViewModel` (`@MainActor ObservableObject`): NSWorkspace launch/terminate
  observers with `nonisolated(unsafe)` storage — the only correct pattern for observers
  that must be removed in `deinit` on a `@MainActor` class (Swift 6 `deinit` is nonisolated).
  250ms debounce on Apple Music availability.
- `ConnectorPickerView`: `NavigationStack` inside a `.sheet` from `IdleView`, with
  `navigationDestination(for: ConnectorType.self)`.
- `AppleMusicConnectionViewModel`: five-state machine
  (idle/connecting/noCurrentPlaylist/notRunning/permissionDenied/error/connected).
  Auto-retry on `.noCurrentPlaylist` via injectable `DelayProviding` (2s real, instant
  in tests). Pre-flight finding: AppleScript error -1728 (no track) and -1743 (automation
  denied) both silently return an empty array — indistinguishable in U.3.
- `AppleMusicConnectionView`: five user-visible states with CTA copy per UX_SPEC §4.3.
  `.onChange(of: viewModel.state)` fires `onConnect(.appleMusicCurrentPlaylist)` on
  `.connected`.
- `SpotifyURLKind` + `SpotifyURLParser`: pure value types. Handles HTTPS, `spotify:` URI,
  `@`-prefixed links, query param stripping, podcast paths → `.invalid`.
- `SpotifyConnectionViewModel`: 300ms debounce on text input via `$text.sink`; HTTP 429
  retry with [2s, 5s, 15s] backoff (extracted to `retryAfterRateLimit` to satisfy
  `cyclomatic_complexity ≤ 10`). `.spotifyAuthRequired` → calls `startSession` directly
  (SessionManager degrades gracefully to live-only reactive mode; no OAuth in U.3).
- `SpotifyConnectionView`: URL paste field, playlist-ID preview card, per-kind rejection
  copy, retry-attempt indicator.
- `DelayProviding` protocol: `RealDelay` (wall-clock `Task.sleep`) and `InstantDelay`
  (`await Task.yield()` — yields actor without wall-clock wait, enabling fast retry tests).
- `LocalFolderConnector` stub: `#if ENABLE_LOCAL_FOLDER_CONNECTOR` compile flag; always
  throws `.networkFailure("not yet implemented")`.
- `IdleView` updated: "Connect a playlist" → `.sheet`, "Start listening now" → ad-hoc
  session. `PhospheneApp.swift` auto-start `startAdHocSession()` removed from `.onAppear`.

**Key decisions (D-046):**
- `nonisolated(unsafe)` for NSWorkspace observer storage in `@MainActor` classes.
- `ConnectorPickerView` as sheet-with-NavigationStack (not a new NavigationStack root).
- `DelayProviding` protocol for testable retry without wall-clock waits.
- `.spotifyAuthRequired` silently degrades — no user-visible error since the session still
  starts (live-only reactive mode is valid and useful without OAuth).

**Tests:** 21 new PhospheneApp tests (ConnectorPickerViewModelTests×9, SpotifyURLParserTests×12,
AppleMusicConnectionViewModelTests×5 + identifier, SpotifyConnectionViewModelTests×5 + identifier).
56 PhospheneApp tests total. 0 SwiftLint violations.

**Verify:**
- `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' test`
- `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml`

---

### Increment U.4 — Preparation progress UI ✅

**Scope:** `PreparationProgressView` per `UX_SPEC.md §5.2`. New `PreparationProgressPublishing` protocol exposed by `SessionPreparer`; publishes `[TrackID: TrackPreparationStatus]` via Combine. `TrackPreparationRow` renders one of seven statuses (`.queued`, `.resolving`, `.downloading`, `.analyzing`, `.ready`, `.partial`, `.failed`) with icon + copy per `§5.3` table. Aggregate progress bar + per-track ETA + cancel affordance. "Start now" CTA appears at `progressiveReadinessLevel == .ready_for_first_tracks` — dependency on Increment 6.1; before 6.1 ships, this CTA is dormant.

**Done when:**
- Track list updates as each track advances through preparation stages.
- `PreparationProgressPublishing` protocol defined in `Session` module; `DefaultSessionPreparer` conforms.
- All seven status cases render correctly with their icons and copy.
- Cancel tears down in-flight work and returns to `.idle` without leaving orphan stem analyses.
- 6+ unit tests, including a flaky-network fixture via `MockPreparationProgressPublisher`.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PreparationProgressTests`

---

### Increment U.5 — Ready view + first-audio autodetect ✅

**Scope:** `ReadyView` per `UX_SPEC.md §6.1`. First-track preset renders in background at 0.3× opacity. Attention-drawing pulsing border. First-audio autodetect via `AudioInputRouter` `.silent → .active` transition sustained >250 ms → auto-advance to `.playing`. 90-second timeout handling per `§6.3`. Plan preview panel (`PlanPreviewView`) showing all `PlannedTrack` rows with transitions. Regenerate Plan (D-047) with random seed + manual-lock preservation.

**Delivered:**
- Part A: `ReadyView`, `ReadyViewModel`, `FirstAudioDetector`, `ReadyPulsingBorder`, `ReadyBackgroundPresetView`.
- Part B: `PlanPreviewView`, `PlanPreviewViewModel`, `PlanPreviewRowView`, `PlanPreviewTransitionView`.
- Part C: `PresetPreviewController` stub — deferred to U.5b (D-048).
- Part D: `DefaultSessionPlanner.plan(seed:)`, `PlannedSession.applying(overrides:)`, `VisualizerEngine.regeneratePlan(lockedTracks:lockedPresets:)`.
- 19 new tests: `FirstAudioDetectorTests`, `ReadyViewModelTests`, `PlanPreviewViewModelTests`, `PlanPreviewRegenerateTests`, `ReadyViewTimeoutIntegrationTests`, `SessionPlannerSeedTests`.

---

### Increment U.5b — Preset preview loop (deferred from U.5 Part C)

**Scope:** 10-second looping preset preview triggered by row-tap in `PlanPreviewView`. Currently a no-op stub in `PresetPreviewController`. Full implementation requires engine-layer changes: (1) synthetic `FeatureVector` injection into active `RenderPipeline`; (2) secondary render surface or background-preset surface hijack; (3) loop mechanism without live audio callbacks. See D-048.

**Done when:**
- Row tap in `PlanPreviewView` triggers a looping 10s preview of the row's preset.
- Tap again or session advance stops the preview and reverts to the session's active preset.
- Context-menu "Swap preset" is enabled and wired to `PlanPreviewViewModel.swapPreset(for:to:)`.
- `PresetPreviewController.startPreview(preset:stems:)` drives the RenderPipeline, not a stub.
- 6+ unit tests for preview controller lifecycle + integration test for row-tap → visual change.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetPreviewTests`

---

### Increment U.5c — Plan modification editor (deferred from U.5 Part C)

**Scope:** Preset picker for manual swap in `PlanPreviewView`. The "Modify" footer button and context-menu "Swap preset" action open a picker sheet showing the preset catalog filtered to eligible candidates for the selected track. Currently disabled with `TODO(U.5.C)` markers.

**Done when:**
- "Swap preset" context-menu action opens a preset picker for the selected track.
- Picker shows eligible presets filtered by device tier and fatigue cooldown.
- Selecting a preset calls `PlanPreviewViewModel.swapPreset(for:to:)` and shows lock badge.
- "Modify" footer button opens the same picker for the last-tapped row.
- 4+ unit tests for picker filtering + view model lock state after swap.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PlanModifyTests`

---

### Increment U.6 — In-session chrome ✅

**Scope:** `PlaybackView` overlay chrome per `UX_SPEC.md §7`. Three layers: Metal render surface (full-bleed), auto-hiding overlay (track info top-left, controls cluster top-right, bottom-right toast slot), debug overlay (toggled with `D`). `OverlayChromeView` with `PlaybackOverlayViewModel` managing visibility + fade timers. Keyboard shortcuts from `§7.6` registered globally within `.playing`. Track-change animation per `§7.5`. Multi-display drag per `§7.7`. Blurred dark backdrop for contrast guarantee.

**Done when:**
- Overlay fades out after 3 s idle; reappears on mouse move or key press.
- Keyboard shortcuts `⌘F`, `Space`, `←`, `→`, `M`, `D`, `Esc`, `?` all wired.
- Track change triggers center toast for 1 s then moves info to top-left card.
- Minimum-contrast 4.5:1 verified against three regression fixtures (silence / steady mid-energy / beat-heavy).
- Display hot-plug reparents window without crash or session loss.
- 8+ unit tests for ViewModel state transitions + snapshot tests for each overlay configuration.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PlaybackChromeTests`

---

### Increment U.6b — Live adaptation keyboard shortcut semantics ✅

**Status: Complete (2026-04-25)**

**What was built:**
- `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter` fully wired — all seven methods (`moreLikeThis`, `lessLikeThis`, `reshuffleUpcoming`, `presetNudge`, `rePlanSession`, `undoLastAdaptation`, `toggleMoodLock`) produce observable state changes. No remaining `TODO(U.6b)` lines.
- `PresetScoringContext` extended with `familyBoosts`, `temporarilyExcludedFamilies`, `sessionExcludedPresets` (all defaulted empty; D-053 backward-compat discipline).
- `PresetScoreBreakdown.familyBoost: Float` added; `DefaultPresetScorer` honours all three new fields.
- `PlannedSession.extendingCurrentPreset(by:at:)` added in `LiveAdapter+Patching` (same controlled-mutation discipline as `applying(_:at:)`).
- `PresetCategory.displayName` computed property for user-facing toast copy.
- `LiveAdaptationToastBridge` default flipped to `true` for fresh installs; existing explicit user choices preserved via the key-presence check.
- Adaptation preference state lives on `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter` (not `VisualizerEngine`) for testability — D-058(e).
- Double-`-` ambient hint: two `lessLikeThis()` calls within 90 s emit "Not quite hitting the mark? Try ⌘R to re-plan." once per session.
- `adaptationHistory` bounded at 8 entries; `undoLastAdaptation()` restores `livePlan` only (NOT preference state) — D-058(b).
- `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator` extended with `extendCurrentPreset(by:)`, `applyPresetByID(_:)`, `restoreLivePlan(_:)`, `buildScoringContext(adaptationFields:)`, `currentTrackIndexInPlan()`, `currentTrackProfile()`.
- `PlaybackView.setup()` uses `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter.live(engine:toastBridge:onShowPlanPreview:)` factory.
- 14 app tests + 6 engine tests (adapatation scorer tests in `PresetScorerAdaptationTests`). D-058.

---

### Increment U.7 — Error taxonomy + toast system ✅

**Status: Complete (2026-04-24)**

**Scope:** `UserFacingError` typed enum and `ErrorToast` view component per `UX_SPEC.md §8`. Every row in the UX_SPEC error tables (§8.1–§8.4) has a corresponding enum case with copy test. All user-facing strings externalized in `Localizable.strings`. `PlaybackView` bottom-right toast slot for degradation messages (silence detection, preview fallback, sample-rate mismatch, etc.). Full-screen error states for connection / preparation failures.

**Delivered (3 commits):**
- **Part A:** `UserFacingError` (29 cases, `Shared` module), `Localizable.strings` (English), `LocalizedCopy` service, retroactive string extraction from U.1–U.6 views. Tests: `UserFacingErrorTests`, `LocalizedCopyTests`.
- **Part B:** `FullScreenErrorView`, `PreparationFailureView`, `TopBannerView` (44pt amber banner), `PreparationErrorViewModel` (6 priority rules), `ReachabilityMonitor` (NWPathMonitor + 1s debounce), `StubReachabilityMonitor`. Wired into `PreparationProgressView`. Tests: `PreparationErrorViewModelTests` (7), `ReachabilityMonitorTests` (3).
- **Part C:** `PhospheneToast.conditionID`, `ToastManager.dismissByCondition/_isConditionAsserted`, `PlaybackErrorConditionTracker`, `PlaybackErrorBridge` (replaces `SilenceToastBridge`; fires at 15s per §9.4; condition-ID auto-dismiss on recovery). Wired into `PlaybackView`. Tests: `ToastManagerConditionTests` (3), `PlaybackErrorConditionTrackerTests` (4), `PlaybackErrorBridgeTests` (8). D-051.

**Done when:**
- ✅ `UserFacingError` has a case for every row in UX_SPEC §8.1–§8.4 tables.
- ✅ Exhaustive copy test: every enum case asserts the exact string returned.
- ✅ `Localizable.strings` complete for v1 English; no inline hardcoded strings in views.
- ✅ Toast auto-dismisses on condition-resolved signals; persists while condition holds.
- ✅ Never shows full-screen error during `.playing`.
- ✅ Every error case has either CTA or auto-retry status indicator.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter UserFacingErrorCopyTests`

---

### Increment U.8 — Settings panel ✅

**Scope:** `SettingsView` sheet per `UX_SPEC.md §9`. Four groups: Audio, Visuals, Diagnostics, About. All fields persisted in `UserDefaults` via `SettingsViewModel`. Settings apply immediately (no "Apply" button). Quality ceiling mid-session applies at next preset transition.

**Landed (2026-04-24):** Three-part delivery across two commits (`5ec23e71`, `b67ec770`).

Part A+B: `SettingsTypes` (5 enums/structs), `QualityCeiling` (Orchestrator module), `SettingsStore` (`phosphene.settings.*` key scheme, 11 properties, `captureModeChanged` subject), `SettingsMigrator`, `SettingsViewModel` + `AboutSectionData`, `SettingsView` (`NavigationSplitView`, 720×520pt), `AudioSettingsSection` + `VisualsSettingsSection` + `DiagnosticsSettingsSection` + `AboutSettingsSection`, `SourceAppPicker` + `PresetCategoryBlocklistPicker`, `CaptureModeReconciler` (LIVE-SWITCH, D-052), `SessionRecorderRetentionPolicy` (injected `now`/`wallClock`, active-session guard), `OnboardingReset`, `PresetScoringContextProvider` (effectiveTier + Part C TODOs).

Part C: `PresetScoringContext` + `excludedFamilies`/`qualityCeiling` (backward-compat defaults, D-053), `DefaultPresetScorer` blocklist+quality-ceiling gates, `PresetScoringContextProvider.build()` wired, `SessionRecorder.init(enabled:)`, `LiveAdaptationToastBridge` key migrated, `PhospheneApp.swift` launch-time migration+pruning, settings gear sheet in `PlaybackView`. 50 `Localizable.strings` keys. 39 app tests + 9 engine tests. 573 engine total; 0 SwiftLint violations.

---

### Increment U.9 — Accessibility pass ✅

**Scope:** `NSWorkspace.accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceMotion` gates `mv_warp` and SSGI temporal feedback. Beat-pulse amplitude clamped to 0.5× when reduced motion is active. Dynamic Type sizing respected across all non-Metal views. VoiceOver labels on interactive elements; render surface marked decorative. Overlay-text contrast measured against the three regression fixtures for every preset; failures gate preset certification.

**Done when:**
- `mv_warp` disabled when reduced motion is active; preset still renders correctly without it.
- SSGI temporal feedback disabled (falls back to non-temporal sampling).
- Beat-pulse amplitude cap verified on beat-heavy fixture.
- Dynamic Type from xSmall to xxxLarge renders without clipping across all non-Metal views.
- VoiceOver rotor reads all interactive elements correctly.
- Contrast test fails a synthetic white-on-white preset fixture; passes against all production presets.
- 8+ unit tests + contrast fixture tests.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter AccessibilityTests`

**Delivered (2026-04-24):** `AccessibilityState` (`@MainActor` ObservableObject, `NSWorkspace` + `ReducedMotionPreference` three-way logic). `RenderPipeline.frameReduceMotion` gates mv_warp via `drawMVWarpReducedMotion`. `RayMarchPipeline.reducedMotion` gates SSGI. Beat-clamp applied to `beatBass/Mid/Treble/Composite` in `draw(in:)` before `renderFrame`. Dynamic Type: all 16 user-facing view files updated (`.system(size:)` → semantic styles). VoiceOver: MetalView hidden, 8 interactive elements labelled, `AccessibilityLabels` service, 14 new `Localizable.strings` keys, `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement` on new toasts. Part C: `QualityGradeIndicator` (shape + letter code for color-blindness), `DebugOverlayView` SIGNAL block updated, `PresetContrastCertificationTests` (WCAG 4.5:1 gate). 14 new tests (5 `AccessibilityStateTests` + 3 `BeatAmplitudeClampTests` + 5 `MVWarpReducedMotionGateTests` + 9 `AccessibilityLabelsTests` + 1 `DynamicTypeRegressionTests` + N×3 `PresetContrastCertificationTests`). D-054.

**Deferred:** Strict photosensitivity mode (flash frequency analysis + frame blanking). SSGI temporal accumulation gate distinct from the frame-level `reducedMotion` flag (currently they are the same flag).

## Phase V — Visual Fidelity Uplift

**Why this phase exists:** six iterations on Volumetric Lithograph, three each on Arachne and Gossamer, produced incremental fixes but never reached a 2026 quality bar. `docs/SHADER_CRAFT.md` documents the root cause: the `ShaderUtilities` library was thin (55 functions, missing every modern shader technique), there was no detail-cascade methodology documented, no material cookbook, no reference-image discipline, no quality rubric beyond "does it compile." The fidelity cap is authoring-vocabulary poverty in documentation, not hardware or Metal.

V.1–V.6 build the authoring vocabulary. V.7–V.12 apply it to the existing presets Matt called out. V.1–V.6 can run in parallel with Phase U; V.7+ starts once the utility library is ready.

### Increment V.1 — Shader utility library: Noise + PBR

**Scope:** New directory tree `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Renderer/Shaders/Utilities/` with subtrees `Noise/` and `PBR/`. ~90 new functions total. Per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §11.2`:
- `Noise/`: Perlin, Worley, Simplex, FBM (fbm4/fbm8/fbm12, vector fbm), RidgedMultifractal, DomainWarp, Curl, BlueNoise, Hash.
- `PBR/`: BRDF (GGX, Lambert, Oren-Nayar, Ashikhmin-Shirley), Fresnel, NormalMapping, POM, Triplanar, DetailNormals, SSS, Fiber (Marschner-lite), Thin (thin-film interference).

SwiftLint `file_length` special-cased for `.metal` files (raise to 1000 or path-exclude); mechanism TBD during implementation per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §16.1`. `PresetLoader+Preamble.swift` extended to include new utility tree before preset code.

**Done when:**
- All listed utility files exist with the function signatures from SHADER_CRAFT recipes.
- `NoiseUtilityTests` and `PBRUtilityTests` pass (visual sanity check: render each primitive to a test texture, dHash against goldens).
- `.metal` files allowed to exceed 400 lines without lint violation.
- Existing presets compile and render unchanged (additive change, no breaking modifications).
- `fbm8`, `warped_fbm`, `ridged_mf`, `triplanar_sample`, `triplanar_normal`, `parallax_occlusion`, `mat_silk_thread` available for preset authoring.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter UtilityTests && xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp build`

---

### Increment V.2 — Shader utility library: Geometry + Volume + Texture ✓ COMPLETE (2026-04-25)

**Scope:** Add `Geometry/`, `Volume/`, `Texture/` subtrees. ~105 new functions. Per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §11.2`:
- `Geometry/` (6 files): SDFPrimitives (30 primitives incl. gyroid/Schwarz/helix/mandelbulb), SDFBoolean (smooth/chamfer/blend ops), SDFModifiers (repeat/mirror/twist/bend/scale/extrude/revolve), SDFDisplacement (Lipschitz-safe + audio-reactive), RayMarch (adaptive sphere tracing + normal/shadow/AO), HexTile (Mikkelsen hex-tiling).
- `Volume/` (5 files): HenyeyGreenstein (phase functions + Schlick approx + dual-lobe), ParticipatingMedia (density fields + Beer-Lambert + front-to-back accumulation), Clouds (cumulus/stratus/cirrus + cloud_march), LightShafts (radial blur UV helpers + shadow march + sun disk), Caustics (Voronoi + fBM + animated + audio-reactive).
- `Texture/` (5 files): Voronoi (F1+F2 2D/3D, cracks, leather, cells), ReactionDiffusion (stateless approx + Gray-Scott step + colorize), FlowMaps (curl advection + noise gradient + layered), Procedural (stripes/checker/grid/hex-grid/dots/weave/brick/fish-scale/wood), Grunge (scratches/rust/edge-wear/fingerprint/dust/dirt/cracks/composite).

**Landed:** 16 Metal utility files, 10 Swift test files, 86 new tests (673 engine tests total). D-055 in DECISIONS.md. Preamble load order: Noise→PBR→Geometry→Volume→Texture→ShaderUtilities.

**PresetRegressionTests:** dHash table unchanged — all existing preset outputs bit-identical.

**Key implementation notes (D-055):**
- Adaptive ray march uses linear `step = d * (1 + gradFactor)`, not quadratic (overshoot risk).
- `perlin3d` is centered at 0 in [-1.2, 1.2]; RD pattern threshold recalibrated accordingly.
- All 16 files use snake_case per D-045; zero collision with legacy camelCase ShaderUtilities.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "SDFPrimitivesTests|SDFBooleanTests|SDFModifiersTests|SDFDisplacementTests|RayMarchAdaptiveTests|HexTileTests|HenyeyGreensteinTests|ParticipatingMediaTests|CloudsTests|LightShaftsTests|CausticsTests|VoronoiTests|ReactionDiffusionTests|FlowMapsTests|ProceduralTests|GrungeTests"`

---

### Increment V.3 — Shader utility library: Color + Materials cookbook

**Scope:** Add `Color/` subtree and `Materials/` cookbook:
- `Color/`: Palettes (IQ cosine, gradients, LUT sampling), ColorSpaces (RGB↔HSV↔Lab↔Oklab), ChromaticAberration, ToneMapping (ACES variants, Reinhard, filmic).
- `Materials/`: Metals.metal (polished chrome, brushed aluminum, gold, copper, ferrofluid), Dielectrics.metal (ceramic, frosted glass, wet stone), Organic.metal (bark, leaf, silk thread, chitin), Exotic.metal (ocean, ink, marble, granite). All 20 recipes from `SHADER_CRAFT.md §4`.

**Done when:**
- All 20 material functions implemented as documented.
- Per-material visual sanity tests render each against a test sphere with standardized lighting.
- Color utilities pass round-trip tests (RGB→Oklab→RGB delta < 0.01).
- Cookbook materials callable from `sceneMaterial()` in ray-march presets.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter MaterialCookbookTests`

---

### Increment V.4 — SHADER_CRAFT reference implementation audit

**Scope:** Read-through and correctness pass over the completed utility library. For every recipe in `SHADER_CRAFT.md §3`–`§8`, verify the utility implementation matches the documented recipe byte-for-byte. Any drift becomes a doc bug or a code bug — both get fixed. Performance measurements: measure each utility's real cost on Tier 1 (M1/M2) and Tier 2 (M3+) hardware; update the cost table in `SHADER_CRAFT.md §9.4` with measured values.

**Done when:**
- Every `SHADER_CRAFT.md` recipe has a corresponding utility function with matching behavior.
- Cost table in §9.4 reflects measured values on both tier classes.
- Discrepancies between doc and code are resolved in favor of the empirically-correct version.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter UtilityCorrectnessTests && swift test --filter UtilityPerformanceTests`

---

### Increment V.5 — Visual references library + quality reel

**Scope:** Create `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/` directory with per-preset folders for all 11 existing presets plus placeholders for Phase MD presets. Each folder: 3–5 curated reference images with an annotated `README.md` specifying which visual traits are mandatory. Matt curates; Claude Code sessions reference by filename. Additionally: build a **quality reel** — a 3-minute multi-genre capture across (sparse jazz → hard electronic → symphonic), used as a one-glance quality-review artifact for future increments.

**Done when:**
- Every existing preset has a `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/<preset>/` folder with reference images and annotated README.
- Quality reel `docs/quality_reel.mp4` checked in (Git LFS).
- `SHADER_CRAFT.md §2.3` reference-image discipline is enforceable — Claude Code sessions cite filenames.
- Matt approves curation round.

**Verify:** Manual Matt review.

---

### Increment V.6 — Fidelity rubric + certification pipeline

**Scope:** Implement the `SHADER_CRAFT.md §12` rubric as automated + manual gates:
- Automated: detail-cascade detection via static analysis of preset Metal source (look for `fbm8` / `worley_fbm` / multiple material calls / triplanar usage); noise-octave counting; material-count verification; D-026 deviation-primitive usage; silence-fallback regression test.
- Manual: Matt-approved reference frame match gates certification.

`PresetDescriptor` gains a `certified: Bool` field. Orchestrator excludes uncertified presets by default. `SettingsView` gets a "Show uncertified presets" toggle (off by default).

Supersedes (without deleting) Increment 5.2's weak invariants — those stay as a passing prerequisite.

**Done when:**
- Automated rubric scores every preset; report prints each preset's 7+4+4 breakdown.
- `certified: Bool` field defaults to false for Matt-approved presets only.
- Orchestrator filter excludes uncertified.
- Toggle in Settings reveals uncertified.
- Increment 5.2 invariants still passing.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter FidelityRubricTests`

---

### Increment V.7 — Arachne v4 (fidelity uplift)

**Scope:** Apply V.1–V.4 utilities and V.5 references to Arachne per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.1`. Key changes: per-web organic variation (tilt/hub/strand-count jitter); per-strand sag/tension variation; adhesive droplets on spiral threads; silk thread Marschner-lite material; dust-mote field; bioluminescent lighting with back-lit rim; audio-reactivity restricted to emission intensity and dust-mote density (D-020 — structure stays solid).

**Done when:**
- Arachne v4 passes fidelity rubric 10/15 minimum including Matt-approved reference frame match.
- Passes Increment 5.2 invariants.
- p95 frame time ≤ Tier 2 budget at 1080p.
- Silk threads visibly narrow (∼1.5 px at 1080p) with axial specular per `04_specular_fiber_highlight.jpg` annotation.
- Adhesive droplets visible at 8–12 px spacing per `03_micro_adhesive_droplet.jpg` annotation.
- Golden hash regenerated; `certified: true`.

**Verify:** `swift test --filter PresetAcceptanceTests && swift test --filter PresetRegressionTests && swift test --filter FidelityRubricTests` + Matt review.

**Estimated sessions:** 3 (geometry + variation / materials / polish + audio routing).

---

### Increment V.8 — Gossamer v4

**Scope:** Apply to Gossamer per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.2`. Physical wave displacement (waves offset silk strand positions, not just tint them); silk Marschner-lite material tuned for hero resonator; fine specular glints at thread intersections; chromatic aberration on wave peaks; inward/outward dust drift; SSGI-lit background from web emission.

**Done when:** same rubric gates as V.7; `certified: true`.

**Verify:** same as V.7.

**Estimated sessions:** 2 (physical displacement rework / atmosphere + chromatic aberration).

---

### Increment V.9 — Ferrofluid Ocean v2

**Scope:** Full rebuild per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.3`. Hex-tile Rosensweig spike lattice (`stems.bass_energy_dev` drives field strength); domain-warped spike positions for organic flow; ferrofluid material with anisotropic reflection along spike axes; distant fog cooling to dark purple; IBL cubemap as primary indirect light; caustic underlighting.

**Done when:** same rubric gates; `certified: true`.

**Verify:** same as V.7.

**Estimated sessions:** 4 (field formulation / material / lighting + IBL / audio routing).

---

### Increment V.10 — Fractal Tree v2

**Scope:** Apply to Fractal Tree per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.4`. Bark material with POM + triplanar + lichen patches; procedural leaf clusters at branch tips with leaf material (SSS back-lit); wind animation via curl-noise; seasonal palette synced with valence; golden-hour lighting with long shadows.

**Done when:** same rubric gates; `certified: true`. Performance profile shows POM + foliage within Tier 2 budget (likely requires MetalFX Temporal upscaling at sub-1080p internal render).

**Verify:** same as V.7.

**Estimated sessions:** 4 (bark + POM / foliage / wind animation / seasonal + audio).

---

### Increment V.11 — Volumetric Lithograph v5

**Scope:** Major rework per `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.5`. Replace fBM heightfield with `ridged_mf` warped by `curl_noise` (mountainous, not lumpy); mesa terrace secondary displacement; triplanar detail normal; aerial perspective fog (color-shift from warm sky to cool depth); drifting cloud shadows; cutting-plane beat-reveal replaces palette flash; retain mv_warp and pitch-color mapping from MV-3.

**Done when:** same rubric gates; `certified: true`. Terrain reads as mountainous, not lumpy — confirmed against `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/volumetric_lithograph/` annotations.

**Verify:** same as V.7.

**Estimated sessions:** 3 (terrain reformulation / aerial + clouds / cutting-plane + polish).

---

### Increment V.12 — Glass Brutalist v2 + Kinetic Sculpture v2

**Scope:** Fidelity uplift for the remaining ray-march presets not covered in V.7–V.11. Glass Brutalist: detail normals on concrete; POM on walls; frosted glass material for fins; volumetric light shafts through windows. Kinetic Sculpture: brushed aluminum material per `§4.2`; polished chrome with anisotropic streaks; dust motes in ambient space.

**Done when:** both presets pass fidelity rubric 10/15 with all mandatory; `certified: true` on both.

**Verify:** same as V.7.

**Estimated sessions:** 3 (Glass Brutalist lift / Kinetic Sculpture lift / joint polish + perf).

---

## Phase MD — Milkdrop Ingestion

**Why this phase exists:** `docs/MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE.md` informed Phosphene's own authoring patterns (MV-0 through MV-3), but the "port the cream of the crop" work track disappeared from the plan. The vehicle for that work — the `mv_warp` render pass (D-027) — is built and sitting largely unused since D-029 pulled it from Starburst and VolumetricLithograph. This phase ingests Jason Fletcher's curated `presets-cream-of-the-crop` pack as Phosphene presets, then upgrades the best with Phosphene's superior capabilities (SSGI, PBR, stems, pitch, beat anticipation) — producing "evolved Milkdrop" presets, not mere clones.

Runs in parallel with Phase V.7+ once Phase V.1–V.3 utilities are available.

### Increment MD.1 — `.milk` grammar audit

**Scope:** New doc `docs/MILKDROP_GRAMMAR.md` cataloguing every per-frame / per-vertex variable, every equation operator, and every function used across the `presets-cream-of-the-crop` pack. Frequency counts so we know which 80% of the language to support first. Milkdrop 2 pixel shaders (warp + composite) analyzed separately — these emit directly as Metal rather than being transpiled from a DSL.

**Done when:**
- Doc enumerates all variables (bass/mid/treb/time/q1–q32/wave_* / mv_* / ob_* / ib_* etc.) observed.
- Top-20 built-in functions (sigmoid, clamp, above, below, if_then_else etc.) have Metal-equivalent code notes.
- Pixel-shader conventions (sampler_main, GetPixel, GetBlur1, GetBlur2, ret, rad, ang, uv, uv_orig, tex2D) documented with Metal mappings.

**Verify:** Manual review against 5 randomly-sampled preset files from the pack.

---

### Increment MD.2 — Transpiler CLI skeleton

**Scope:** New SPM executable target `PhospheneTools/MilkdropTranspiler`. Lexes `.milk` files; emits a Swift AST. No code generation yet — this increment proves the parser covers the grammar surface. Ships as a standalone tool so transpiler bugs never affect the Phosphene runtime (Option B from the improvement plan).

**Done when:**
- Can parse 100% of the cream-of-the-crop pack without lexer / parser errors.
- Round-trips AST to readable pretty-print; diffing the pretty-print against the original is semantically equivalent (modulo whitespace).
- Test suite: 10+ fixture presets covering grammar edge cases.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneTools --filter MilkdropTranspilerParserTests`

---

### Increment MD.3 — Per-frame → JSON emission

**Scope:** Transpiler extends AST → JSON emission. Per-frame equations that map to `PresetDescriptor` parameters (`base_zoom`, `base_rot`, `decay`, etc.) emit as JSON sidecar. Per-frame `q1`–`q32` user variables emit as a fixed-size uniform buffer alongside `FeatureVector`.

**Done when:**
- Transpiler generates valid `.json` sidecars for 20 test presets.
- Round-trip test verifies semantic equivalence for the supported per-frame operator subset.
- Unsupported operators (rare cases) emit a clear diagnostic with the offending line; doesn't crash.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneTools --filter PerFrameEmissionTests`

---

### Increment MD.4 — Per-vertex → Metal emission

**Scope:** Transpiler extends to per-vertex emission: Milkdrop per-vertex equations compile to `mvWarpPerVertex` Metal function bodies. Per-frame state threaded through the `q1`–`q32` uniform buffer. Milkdrop 2 warp / composite pixel shaders compile directly to their Metal equivalents using the `sampler_main` → `warpTexture` mapping.

**Done when:**
- 5 hand-selected reference presets (including at least one Milkdrop 1 and one Milkdrop 2 preset) compile via transpiler and render in Phosphene.
- Transpiled presets bind to the existing `mv_warp` render pass.
- Golden hash regression added per transpiled preset.
- Visual sanity check: transpiled preset output resembles projectM's render of the same preset.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter MilkdropTranspiledPresetTests`

---

### Increment MD.5 — Ingestion harness + first 10 cream-of-the-crop presets

**Scope:** Pick 10 Jason Fletcher presets spanning families (geometric, fractal, organic, kaleidoscopic, abstract). Run transpiler, inspect output, polish each until visual match against projectM render is acceptable. These presets are marked `family: "milkdrop_classic"` and tagged for the "Include Milkdrop-style presets" user toggle in Settings.

**Done when:**
- 10 new presets in `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Milkdrop/` with JSON sidecars.
- Each has a golden-session regression entry and Increment 5.2 acceptance test.
- Orchestrator metadata (`visual_density`, `motion_intensity`, `fatigue_risk`, etc.) hand-authored per preset for planning integration.
- User-settings toggle "Include Milkdrop-style presets" honored (Increment U.8).
- **D-043 added to DECISIONS.md**: "Milkdrop presets ingested via offline transpiler + manual uplift; no runtime .milk parser."

**Verify:** `swift test --filter PresetAcceptanceTests` (auto-covers new presets via existing regression gate).

---

### Increment MD.6 — Next 20 presets + stem-aware upgrade

**Scope:** Next 20 cream-of-the-crop presets. Each manually upgraded with **at least two** of: stem-driven parameter routing (replacing `bass`/`mid`/`treb` with per-stem equivalents), beat-phase anticipation via MV-3b `beat_phase01`, pitch-hue mapping via MV-3c `vocalsPitchHz`, MV-3a rich stem metadata. These are the "evolved Milkdrop" presets — keep the visual DNA but exploit Phosphene's audio pipeline.

**Done when:**
- 20 more presets in the library.
- Each preset's JSON documents which MV-3 capabilities it uses (new `mv3_features_used: [...]` array field).
- No original preset is regressed — the unmodified version from MD.5 stays available under a separate ID for A/B comparison.
- All 30 Milkdrop presets pass Increment 5.2 acceptance.

**Verify:** `swift test --filter PresetAcceptanceTests`

---

### Increment MD.7 — Ray-march hybrids (evolved Milkdrop)

**Scope:** For the best 5 Milkdrop presets from MD.5–MD.6, author a companion ray-march layer that renders 3D depth behind the 2D warp plane. Static-camera only, per D-029 — no moving-camera hybrids. Kept as separate presets prefixed `evolved/`. Uses the full utility library from Phase V.

**Done when:**
- 5 hybrid presets composed of `["ray_march", "mv_warp", "post_process"]`.
- Each passes the V.6 fidelity rubric (10/15 including mandatory).
- Performance verified on Tier 1 and Tier 2 — hybrids are more expensive and may be Tier-2-only.
- Matt approves reference frame match for each.

**Verify:** `swift test --filter PresetAcceptanceTests && swift test --filter FidelityRubricTests`

---

## Phase 6 — Progressive Readiness & Performance Tiering

### Increment 6.1 — Progressive Session Readiness ✅ (2026-04-25)

**Scope:** Replace the binary preparation model with graduated readiness. States: `preparing`, `ready_for_first_tracks` (first N tracks analyzed), `partially_planned` (visual arc provisional), `fully_prepared` (all tracks analyzed, full plan), `reactive_fallback` (no preparation possible).

**What was built:**
- `ProgressiveReadinessLevel` (5-case `Comparable` enum) in `SessionTypes.swift`.
- `SessionManager.startSession()` now returns immediately after connecting; preparation runs in a stored `Task { @MainActor }`. `progressiveReadinessLevel` is published and recomputed from `@Published trackStatuses` subscription on every status change.
- `SessionManager.startNow()` advances `.preparing → .ready` when readiness ≥ `.readyForFirstTracks`; background task continues so remaining tracks are cached during playback.
- `SessionManager.computeReadiness(statuses:trackList:cache:)` — static pure function implementing D-056 rules: consecutive-prefix gate (default threshold = 3), `.partial` tracks count only when profile has BPM + genre tags, `allTerminal` short-circuits to `fullyPrepared`/`reactiveFallback`.
- `PlannedSession.appendingWarnings(_:)` (now `public`) and `PlanningWarning.Kind.partialPreparation(unplannedCount:)` with hand-written Codable (associated value incompatible with `CaseIterable`).
- `VisualizerEngine`: `currentSessionPlanSeed` stored for deterministic re-use; `extendPlan()` rebuilds plan with same seed on readiness update; `progressiveReadinessLevel` subscription drives `buildPlan()`/`extendPlan()` routing.
- `PreparationProgressViewModel`: removed `FeatureFlags` gate; `canStartNow` driven by injected `progressiveReadinessPublisher`; `onStartNow` closure forwarded from `SessionManager.startNow()`.
- `PlaybackChromeViewModel`: `isBackgroundPreparationActive` (`level < .fullyPrepared`) drives teal dot in `PlaybackControlsCluster`.
- 14 new tests: 10 `ProgressiveReadinessTests` (engine) + 2 `PartialPlanTests` (engine) + 2 `PreparationProgressVMReadinessTests` (app). 685 engine tests total; 0 SwiftLint violations.

**Done when:** ✅ User can start playback when first 3 tracks are prepared. ✅ SessionManager exposes readiness level. ✅ Orchestrator partial-plan mode with `partialPreparation` warning. ✅ 14 tests (≥ 6 required).

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine`

---

### ✅ Increment 6.2 — Frame Budget Manager (landed 2026-04-25)

**What was built:** `FrameBudgetManager.swift` — pure-state governor with 6-level `QualityLevel` ladder (`full → noSSGI → noBloom → reducedRayMarch → reducedParticles → reducedMesh`), `Configuration` factories (tier1: 14ms/0.3ms margin; tier2: 16ms/0.5ms margin), asymmetric hysteresis (3 overruns down / 180 frames up), `reset()` on preset change. OR-gate refactor of `RayMarchPipeline.reducedMotion` → `a11yReducedMotion || governorSkipsSSGI` with dedicated setters (D-057). `PostProcessChain.bloomEnabled`, `ProceduralGeometry.activeParticleFraction`, `MeshGenerator.densityMultiplier`, `RayMarchPipeline.stepCountMultiplier` (written to `sceneParamsB.z`). Timing via `commandBuffer.addCompletedHandler` → `@MainActor` hop. `QualityCeiling.ultra` exempts the governor. Debug overlay quality level line. 36 new tests across 5 files. Golden hashes regenerated for VolumetricLithograph + KineticSculpture (preamble compiler optimization). 721 engine tests total; 1 pre-existing flaky timer failure unchanged.

---

### ✅ Increment 6.3 — ML Dispatch Scheduling (landed 2026-04-25)

**What was built:**
- `MLDispatchScheduler.swift` (`Renderer` module): pure-state controller with `Configuration` (tier defaults: 2000ms/30-frame Tier 1, 1500ms/20-frame Tier 2), `Decision` enum (`.dispatchNow / .defer(retryInMs:) / .forceDispatch`), `DispatchContext` value type, and `decide(context:) -> Decision` algorithm. `QualityCeiling.ultra` → `enabled = false` bypass. D-059.
- `FrameTimingProviding` protocol in `MLDispatchScheduler.swift`: `recentMaxFrameMs` + `recentFramesObserved`. `FrameBudgetManager` conforms via extension; test stubs use `StubFrameTimingProvider`. Single rolling buffer (30-slot circular array) in `FrameBudgetManager` serves both governor hysteresis counters and the ML scheduler with no duplicate state. D-059(e).
- `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift` restructured: `runStemSeparation()` hops to `@MainActor`, consults the scheduler, then dispatches back to `stemQueue` via `performStemSeparation()`. `pendingDispatchStartTime` tracks deferral duration; cleared on dispatch and on `resetStemPipeline(for:)` track change.
- `VisualizerEngine` gains `deviceTier: DeviceTier` (stored, set in `init()`), `mlDispatchScheduler: MLDispatchScheduler?`, and `pendingDispatchStartTime: TimeInterval?`. Debug overlay `ML:` row shows current scheduler state (idle / dispatch / defer Nms / force).
- `MLDispatchSchedulerTests.swift`: 10 `@Test` functions. `MLDispatchSchedulerWiringTests.swift`: 5 `@Test` functions (incl. `StubFrameTimingProvider`). 20 new tests total.
- `DECISIONS.md` D-059 (5 sub-decisions). `ARCHITECTURE.md` §ML Inference gains Dispatch Scheduling subsection. `RUNBOOK.md §Jank / dropped frames` updated. `CLAUDE.md` Module Map and §ML Inference updated.
- 747 engine tests; 0 SwiftLint violations. Phase 6 complete.

**Done when:** ✅ Scheduler defers dispatch when recent frames are over budget. ✅ Force-dispatch ceiling prevents stem freeze. ✅ 20 new tests (≥ 4 required). ✅ Zero dHash drift.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "MLDispatchScheduler"`

---

## Phase 7 — Long-Session Stability

### Increment 7.1 — Soak Test Infrastructure ✅ **LANDED 2026-04-26**

**Scope:** Automated 2+ hour test sessions with synthetic audio. Monitor: memory growth, frame timing drift, dropped frames, state machine integrity, permission handling.

**Delivered:**
- `Diagnostics` SPM target: `MemoryReporter` (`phys_footprint` via TASK_VM_INFO), `FrameTimingReporter` (100-bucket histogram + 1000-frame rolling window), `SoakTestHarness` (@MainActor, configurable duration, cancel(), JSON+Markdown reports).
- `SoakRunner` CLI executable with `--duration`, `--sample-interval`, `--audio-file`, `--report-dir` options. `Scripts/run_soak_test.sh` wraps `caffeinate -i` for 2-hour runs.
- `RenderPipeline.onFrameTimingObserved` fan-out closure: single `commandBuffer.addCompletedHandler` source feeds both `FrameBudgetManager` and soak harness. D-060(c).
- `MLDispatchScheduler.forceDispatchCount` public counter.
- Procedural audio fixture: 10s sine sweep (100→4000 Hz) + noise + 120 BPM kicks, generated at runtime. D-060(e).
- 19 new tests: `MemoryReporterTests` (5), `FrameTimingReporterTests` (7), `SoakTestHarnessTests` (7 always-run + 2 SOAK_TESTS=1 gated).
- 766 engine tests total. 0 SwiftLint violations.

**Smoke run results (60s):** Run `SOAK_TESTS=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter SoakTestHarnessTests` to populate.

**Verify:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` (soak tests gated by SOAK_TESTS=1 env var)

### Increment 7.2 — Display Hot-Plug & Source Switching ✅ **LANDED 2026-04-26**

**Scope:** Handle external display connect/disconnect during a session. Handle switching between capture modes (system → app → system). Handle playlist reconnection after network interruption.

**What landed:**
- `FrameBudgetManager.resetRecentFrameBuffer()` — clears rolling timing window only, preserving `currentLevel` (D-061(a))
- `DisplayChangeCoordinator` — subscribes to `DisplayManager` publishers; calls `resetRecentFrameBuffer()` on active-screen removal or window move; no session-state changes
- `CaptureModeSwitchCoordinator` + `CaptureModeSwitchEngineInterface` — 5-second grace window on non-`.localFile` mode switches; suppresses `presetOverride` events in `applyLiveUpdate`; raises silence toast threshold to 20 s (D-061(b,c))
- `PlaybackErrorBridge.effectiveThresholdSeconds` — mutable threshold replacing static constant; `silenceToastGraceWindowThresholdSeconds = 20`
- `VisualizerEngine.captureModeSwitchGraceWindowEndsAt` + `isCaptureModeSwitchGraceActive` — grace window state, with `CaptureModeSwitchEngineInterface` conformance
- `SessionPreparer.resumeFailedNetworkTracks()` — retries network-class failures only; pass-through on `SessionManager` (D-061(d))
- `NetworkRecoveryCoordinator` — 2s additional debounce, 3-attempt cap, state guard via injected `sessionStatePublisher` (D-061(e))
- 4 test files: `DisplayChangeCoordinatorTests` (6), `CaptureModeSwitchCoordinatorTests` (5), `NetworkRecoveryCoordinatorTests` (6), `DrawableResizeRegressionTests` (3) — 20 new tests total
- D-061 in DECISIONS.md; ARCHITECTURE.md resilience subsection; RUNBOOK.md 3 new failure modes

**Phase 7 complete.**

## Milestones

These milestones map to product-level outcomes, not implementation phases.

**Milestone A — Trustworthy Playback Session.** ✅ **MET (2026-04-25).** A user can connect a playlist, obtain a usable prepared session, and complete a full listening session without instability. *Requires: ~~2.5.4~~ ✅, ~~Phase U increments U.1–U.7~~ ✅, ~~progressive readiness basics (6.1)~~ ✅.*

**Milestone B — Tasteful Orchestration.** ✅ **MET (2026-04-25).** Preset choice and transitions are consistently better than random and pass golden-session tests. *Requires: ~~Phase 4 complete~~ ✅, ~~Increment 5.1~~ ✅ (landed as 4.0).*

**Milestone C — Device-Aware Show Quality.** ✅ **MET (2026-04-25).** The same playlist produces an excellent show on M1 and a richer one on M4 without jank. *Requires: ~~Phase 6 complete~~ ✅.*

**Milestone D — Library Depth.** The preset catalog is large enough, varied enough, and well-tagged enough for Phosphene to feel like a product rather than a tech demo. *Requires: Phase 5 complete, Phase V complete (12 fidelity-uplifted presets), Phase MD through MD.5 minimum (10 Milkdrop presets), 22+ certified presets total.*

**Milestone E — Visual Identity.** Phosphene's preset catalog has a recognizable aesthetic ceiling that reads as 2026-quality — comparable to indie-game-released visuals, not 2006-era ShaderToy. *Requires: Phase V complete, Phase V.7–V.11 uplifts all Matt-approved, accessibility pass (U.9).*
