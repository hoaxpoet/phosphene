# Phosphene — Decision Log

Append-only. Each decision records the what, why, and any relevant context that would prevent a future contributor from re-litigating it. Decisions are numbered sequentially and never removed — superseded decisions are marked as such with a pointer to the replacement.

---

## D-001: Native macOS / Apple Silicon only

**Status:** Accepted

Phosphene is a native macOS app built with Swift and Metal, targeting Apple Silicon (M1+) exclusively.

**Reason:** The product depends on UMA zero-copy memory, Metal mesh shaders, MPSGraph inference, and Core Audio taps. Intel-era constraints would dilute every performance budget. No iOS, no Catalyst, no Electron, no cross-platform.

---

## D-002: Core Audio taps as default capture path

**Status:** Accepted

Default capture uses `AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap` (macOS 14.2+). ScreenCaptureKit was explored and abandoned.

**Reason:** ScreenCaptureKit (`SCStream` with `capturesAudio = true`) delivers video frames but zero audio callbacks on macOS 15+. Root cause unknown. Core Audio taps work reliably and are purpose-built for audio tapping.

**Note:** The capture architecture remains provider-oriented (`AudioInputRouter` abstracts `.systemAudio`, `.application`, `.localFile`). The provider model is preserved for future fallback paths and testability.

---

## D-003: Local-only processing

**Status:** Accepted

Audio analysis, stem separation, preference learning, and all adaptation remain on-device.

**Reason:** Privacy, latency, product simplicity. No cloud, no telemetry, no data leaves the machine.

---

## D-004: Continuous energy is the primary visual driver

**Status:** Accepted

Continuous band energy drives visual motion. Beat onsets are accent-only.

**Reason:** Beat-dominant visuals have ±80ms jitter from threshold-crossing detection. The feedback loop amplifies this jitter, making beat-dominant designs feel out of sync. Continuous energy values are perfectly synchronized by definition. This lesson required multiple failed approaches in the Electron prototype to learn. Non-negotiable.

---

## D-005: Protocol-oriented cross-module design

**Status:** Accepted

Major dependencies are injected through protocols. No singletons.

**Reason:** Testability and modularity. Every subsystem has test doubles in `Tests/TestDoubles/`.

---

## D-006: UMA shared buffers

**Status:** Accepted

All shared render/analysis buffers use `.storageModeShared`.

**Reason:** Avoid implicit copies. Preserve Apple Silicon UMA zero-copy between CPU, GPU, and ML.

---

## D-007: Runtime preset discovery

**Status:** Accepted

Presets are discovered automatically by scanning the presets directory and compiled at runtime via `device.makeLibrary(source:options:)`.

**Reason:** Eliminates manual registration. Supports hot-reload for development iteration.

---

## D-008: Playlist-first session preparation

**Status:** Accepted

When a playlist is known, Phosphene prepares a full visual session before playback starts.

**Reason:** The product's differentiator is premeditated sequencing. Preview clips are analyzed via stem separation + MIR, results cached in StemCache, and the Orchestrator plans preset selection and transition timing for the entire playlist.

---

## D-009: No CoreML dependency (MPSGraph + Accelerate)

**Status:** Accepted (replaced D-008a: CoreML for ML inference)

All ML inference uses MPSGraph (GPU, Float32) for stem separation and Accelerate/vDSP for mood classification. The CoreML framework was removed entirely in Phase 3.7.

**Reason:** CoreML's ANE path outputs Float16 requiring ~420ms conversion overhead. MPSGraph runs Float32 throughout, eliminates the conversion bottleneck, and achieves 142ms warm predict (4.4× faster than CoreML's ~620ms). CoreML also could not convert HTDemucs or Open-Unmix's full pipeline due to complex tensor ops.

---

## D-010: Open-Unmix HQ as stem separation model

**Status:** Accepted

Open-Unmix HQ (umxhq) is the stem separation model, reconstructed entirely in MPSGraph.

**Reason:** HTDemucs was first choice but fails CoreML/MPSGraph conversion due to complex tensor ops (`view_as_complex`, dynamic shape calculations). Open-Unmix's LSTM architecture converts cleanly. 172 weight tensors (135.9 MB Float32), stored as raw `.bin` files, tracked via Git LFS.

---

## D-011: iTunes Search API for preview resolution

**Status:** Accepted

Preview clip URLs are resolved via the iTunes Search API (`previewUrl` field).

**Reason:** Universal, free, no auth required, works for any track in the Apple Music catalog regardless of the user's streaming source. Rate limited at 20 req/min (handled by sliding-window limiter in PreviewResolver).

---

## D-012: MusicBrainz as free metadata backbone

**Status:** Accepted

MusicBrainz recording search provides genre tags and duration as a free, always-available metadata source.

**Reason:** No API key required. Sufficient for genre classification. Soundcharts is available as an optional commercial supplement for BPM/key/energy features.

---

## D-013: Spotify Audio Features endpoint dropped

**Status:** Accepted

Spotify is search-only for track matching. The Audio Features endpoint was deprecated for new apps (Nov 2024, returns 403).

**Reason:** External constraint. Soundcharts is the commercial replacement for audio feature data. Self-computed MIR is the authoritative source.

---

## D-014: Orchestrator as explicit scoring/policy system

**Status:** Proposed

The Orchestrator will be a scored decision model with explicit inputs (energy trajectory, section confidence, stem salience, visual fatigue, preset novelty, transition compatibility, performance cost) and testable golden-session fixtures.

**Reason:** The Orchestrator is the product's key differentiator. It cannot remain a black box or a stub. Explicit policy with curated test fixtures is the only way to catch regressions in show quality.

---

## D-015: Render graph replaces boolean capability flags

**Status:** Accepted

`RenderPass` enum and `PresetDescriptor.passes: [RenderPass]` replaced scattered boolean flags (`useFeedback`, `useMeshShader`, etc.).

**Reason:** Data-driven render loop. Extensible without adding more booleans. Backward-compatible JSON decoding via `synthesizePasses(from:)`.

---

## D-016: Warnings-as-errors via xcconfig, not command line

**Status:** Accepted

`SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS = YES` is set in `PhospheneApp/Phosphene.xcconfig`, never on the `xcodebuild` command line.

**Reason:** Command-line flag propagates to SPM dependencies that compile with `-suppress-warnings`, causing driver-level conflicts.

---

## D-017: SessionState and SessionPlan live in the Session module, not Shared

**Status:** Accepted

`SessionState` (the lifecycle enum) and `SessionPlan` (the pre-session track sequence stub) are defined in `Session/SessionTypes.swift`, not in `Shared`.

**Reason:** `Shared` sits at the bottom of the dependency graph and cannot import `Session`. `TrackIdentity` — which `SessionPlan` contains — is already in `Session`. Placing `SessionState` in `Shared` would have gained nothing (only `Session` and the app layer reference it) and created a false impression that it is a general-purpose type.

**Corollary:** `SessionPlan` is deliberately minimal for now (holds `[TrackIdentity]`). The Orchestrator (Phase 4) will extend it with preset assignments and transition timing, but that extension belongs in the `Orchestrator` module, not `Session`.

---

## D-019: Stem routing warmup fallback pattern for compute presets

**Status:** Accepted

Compute kernels that route `StemFeatures` to visual parameters must handle the ~10s warmup window before live stems are available. The accepted pattern: detect zero stems via `smoothstep(0.02, 0.06, totalStemEnergy)` and mix between FeatureVector 6-band fallback values and true stem values. When total stem energy is below the lower threshold, pure FeatureVector routing applies (identical behavior to the pre-stem implementation). When above the upper threshold, full stem routing applies.

**Reason:** In ad-hoc mode and at the start of each track in session mode, `StemFeatures` is `.zero` for up to 10–15 seconds. A kernel that reads zero stems without fallback produces flat, unresponsive visuals during this window. The smoothstep crossfade makes the transition invisible — the kernel degrades gracefully to full-mix frequency analysis rather than going dark.

**Implication for new particle/compute presets:** Any preset that uses `buffer(3)` for stem routing should implement this pattern or an equivalent. The crossfade range (0.02–0.06) is intentionally narrow so the transition completes within the first few update cycles once stems arrive.

---

## D-018: SessionManager degrades to ready on any preparation failure

**Status:** Accepted

If `PlaylistConnector.connect()` throws, `SessionManager` transitions to `ready` with an empty plan. If `SessionPreparer.prepare()` completes with some failed tracks, `SessionManager` transitions to `ready` with a partial plan. The manager never becomes stuck in `connecting` or `preparing`.

**Reason:** Metadata degradation principle: Phosphene must be functional at every tier. An empty or partial session plan means the engine runs in reactive mode for uncached tracks — a worse experience than a full session, but a valid one. Surfacing a hard failure from the session lifecycle would force the UI to handle an error state that has no natural recovery path short of starting over.

**Implication for tests:** Tests that verify degradation behavior must cover both failure modes (connector failure → empty plan, resolver failure → partial plan) independently.
