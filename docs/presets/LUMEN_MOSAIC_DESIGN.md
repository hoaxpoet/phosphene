# Lumen Mosaic Design Doc

**Status:** **CERTIFIED 2026-05-12 at LM.7.** Phase LM CLOSED. `LumenMosaic.json` `certified: true`. `"Lumen Mosaic"` ∈ `FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets`. First catalog preset to land cert. Document refreshed 2026-05-12 to reflect actual landed shape (LM.4.6 palette + LM.6 depth gradient + LM.7 per-track tint), correcting the prior revision's aspirational reference to "LM.6 = Cook-Torrance specular sparkle" — that path was abandoned per the LM.3.2 round-7 / Failed Approach lock, and LM.6 as actually shipped is albedo-only modulation with the SDF normal still flat.

**Live contract — what the preset actually is.** A flat `sd_box` glass panel filling the camera frame. Surface is hex-biased Voronoi cells with per-cell dome+ridge relief and in-cell frost (`mat_pattern_glass`, V.3 §4.5b). Each cell carries a deterministic per-cell colour produced by a 32-bit hash → RGB function keyed on `(cellHash, beat-step counters, per-track seed, section salt)`, plus a per-track chromatic-projected RGB tint vector derived from `lumen.trackPaletteSeed{A,B,C}`. The pattern engine introduced in LM.2/LM.4 was retired in LM.4.4; agent-driven backlight (LM.2/LM.3.1) was retired in LM.3.2; the IQ cosine palette (LM.3/LM.4.5.x) was retired in LM.4.6. Brightness is uniform with light hash jitter `[0.85, 1.15]` plus a bar pulse on downbeats. **LM.6** adds two albedo-only modulations to each cell between the palette lookup and the frost diffusion: a depth gradient (full brightness at cell centre, 0.55 × hue at cell boundary — gives each cell a "domed 3D-glass" read) and an optional hot-spot (30 % brightness boost at the inner 15 % of each cell, additive on the cell's own hue). **The SDF normal stays flat and the matID==1 lighting path still skips Cook-Torrance entirely** — LM.6 is per-pixel Voronoi-driven albedo shading, not a normal-driven specular pass. **LM.7** adds a small per-track RGB tint vector with mean-subtraction (chromatic projection) before the saturate-clamp, so each track plays at a visibly distinct aggregate panel mean while every cell still independently samples the full uniform random RGB cube.

**Why this revision is so terse on the "proposed architecture".** Sections 4 and 7 of the previous revision proposed a layered system — agent dance, procedural palette, mood-coupled `(a, b, c, d)` parameters, pattern engine v1/v2, per-stem hue affinity, silhouette occluders. Almost every layer was either rejected at production review or retired during iteration. Documenting the proposed architecture as if it were current would be a documentation lie. This revision describes what shipped.

## 1. Why this preset exists

The reference images (`04_specular_pattern_glass_closeup.jpg` for cell + frost detail, `05_lighting_pattern_glass_dual_color.jpg` for the saturated multi-colour backlight character) show hammered pattern glass — irregular hex-biased cells, each a raised dimple separated by sharp inter-cell ridges, every cell carrying a fine bumpy frost that catches light at sub-pixel scale, and strong coloured light behind. **Each cell carries its own colour**, vivid, often differing markedly from its neighbours.

Phosphene's catalog has the material for this (`mat_pattern_glass`, V.3 Materials cookbook §4.5b) but no preset that uses pattern glass as the entire visual surface with vivid per-cell colour driven by music. Lumen Mosaic is that preset.

**Aesthetic role: an energetic dance partner.** The preset that makes people want to get up and dance. Cells change constantly — every cell carries its own evolving colour, and on a kick-driven track the field of cells reads as a vibrant honeycomb pulsing in time with the music. None of the other ray-march presets sits in that pocket — Volumetric Lithograph is gestural terrain, Glass Brutalist depicts moving architecture, Kinetic Sculpture is geometric motion. Lumen Mosaic owns the **vibrant-cell-field-dancing-with-the-music** register.

Phosphene-wide invariant (CLAUDE.md): muted palettes have no place in the catalog. Quiet moments exist (silence, breakdowns, intros) but the active visual register is always vivid, saturated, alive.

This is **not** Glass Brutalist v3. Glass Brutalist depicts brutalist concrete corridor architecture with pattern glass as one element in a bigger spatial composition; Lumen Mosaic has no depicted architectural scene — the glass *is* the scene, and colour through the glass is the music.

## 2. Constraints (non-negotiable)

Inherited from CLAUDE.md and DECISIONS.md. Not relitigated here.

1. **Performance ceiling — Tier 1: 14 ms / Tier 2: 16 ms** (FrameBudgetManager). Lumen Mosaic targets **the cheapest ray-march preset in the catalog**: p95 ≤ 3.7 ms at Tier 2, ≤ 4.5 ms at Tier 1. Measured on M2 Pro in session `2026-05-12T17-15-14Z`: `frame_gpu_ms` mean 1.37 ms / max 32.9 ms / 3 of 14622 frames > 16 ms (0.02 %). Per-pixel cost is dominated by `voronoi_f1f2` calls + the matID==1 emission composite (Cook-Torrance is intentionally skipped). LM.6 and LM.7 add zero render passes — both are albedo modulations inside `sceneMaterial`, driven by per-pixel scalars already computed.

2. **D-020 architecture-stays-solid.** The glass panel is fixed structure. Audio reactivity routes to per-cell beat-step counters, hash-driven colour, and the bar pulse — never to panel geometry, never to cell shape, never to cell positions. The Voronoi seed lattice is constant for the lifetime of the preset.

3. **D-026 deviation primitives only.** All audio drivers use `_rel` / `_dev` / `_att_rel` fields, never raw `f.bass` / `f.mid` / `f.treble`. Documented exception: the per-cell colour engine uses `f.beatBass` / `f.beatMid` / `f.beatTreble` as rising-edge triggers on the FFT beat envelopes — these are event signals, not energy reads, and `BeatDetector` already gates them through onset detection.

4. **D-019 silence fallback.** At `totalStemEnergy == 0`, cells hold their previous palette state (counters stop advancing). Brightness floor keeps cells visibly coloured.

5. **D-021 sceneMaterial signature.** Standard signature; `StemFeatures` not in scope for `sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial`. The preset uses `f` directly with D-019 fallback patterns.

6. **D-037 acceptance invariants.** Non-black at silence, no white clip on steady, beat response ≤ 2× continuous response + 1.0, form complexity ≥ 2 at silence. Cell-quantized output naturally satisfies form complexity.

7. **Continuous energy primary, beats accent.** D-004. The bar pulse on downbeats is an accent layer. The beat-step counters are event-shaped (rising-edge of FFT band envelopes); each counter advance is a single discrete step, not a continuous modulation.

8. **Detail cascade mandate** (CLAUDE.md, SHADER_CRAFT.md §2.2). Four scales of variation:
   - Macro: cell layout (Voronoi at scale ≈ 60 — implementation drifted from the original C.2 ~50-cells target to ~30 cells across during LM.3.2 round 2, see §6).
   - Meso: per-cell dome shading from the LM.6 depth gradient (`cell_hue *= mix(0.55, 1.0, depth01(f1, f2))`) — full brightness at cell centre, 0.55 × hue at boundary; reads as "domed glass" without geometric perturbation.
   - Micro: in-cell frost mixed into albedo via Voronoi-distance diffusion (LM.3.2 round 7 — no normal artifacts).
   - Specular breakup: the LM.6 hot-spot adds a 30 %-brightness pinpoint at the inner 15 % of each cell. **Albedo-only**, additive on the cell's own hue (not toward white) — palette character preserved. The SDF normal stays flat; no Cook-Torrance specular pass is invoked on matID==1.

9. **No external dependencies.** Stays on Metal + the V.1–V.3 utility library. No new utility modules required.

10. **I (Claude) cannot see rendered output.** Every visual judgment in implementation comes from Matt. Phase boundaries require Matt-driven contact-sheet review against the reference images and against silence / steady / beat-heavy / mood-quadrant / per-track fixtures.

## 3. Decisions in force

After multiple rounds of iteration, the decisions that govern the current implementation are:

| Decision | Status | What it says |
|---|---|---|
| **A.1** Lumen Mosaic | ✅ | Preset name. |
| **B.1** Analytical agent contributions, no behind-glass geometry | ⚠ scaffold-only | The 4-light agent struct stays on the GPU buffer for ABI continuity but is *unused* by the current shader. LM.3.1 retired agent-driven backlight character; LM.4.4 retired agent-position-driven patterns. |
| **C.2** ~50 cells across | ⚠ drifted | LM.3.2 round 2 reduced `kCellDensity` from 30 → 15 (cells across 60 → 30). The implementation is closer to C.1 (~30 cells across); the parameter survives as a JSON-tunable. |
| ~~**D.1** Cell-quantized agent sample~~ | ⊘ retired | LM.2 production failure mode — adjacent cells got nearly identical colours from a smooth analytical light field. |
| ~~**D.4** Per-cell `palette()` keyed on `cell_hash + accumulated_audio_time × kCellHueRate + mood`~~ | ⊘ retired | LM.3 production failure mode — Spotify volume normalisation (BUG-012) under-reads mid + treble bands; `accumulated_audio_time` advanced ~10× too slowly to read as motion. |
| ~~**D.5** Band-routed beat-driven dance (HSV palette, 4 teams, debounced rising-edges)~~ | ⊘ retired by LM.4.6 | LM.3.2 shipped this and Matt M7-passed it 2026-05-10 — but the palette breadth ask in subsequent M7 reviews ("I literally want ANY possible color to be possible within ANY cell") could not be satisfied within an HSV-with-rules formulation. |
| **D.6** Pure uniform random RGB per cell, keyed on `(cellHash, beat-step counters, per-track seed, section salt)` | ✅ in force | The LM.4.6 contract. Each `(cell, beat, track, section)` tuple gets a unique 32-bit colour hash → RGB ∈ [0, 1]. No HSV indirection, no coupling rule, no mood gamma, no saturation floor, no palette parameters. The team / period / counter architecture from D.5 is preserved as the *trigger* mechanism; only the colour decoder changed. |
| ~~**E.1** Cream-baseline mood tint~~ | ⊘ retired | LM.1 / LM.2 production failure mode — muted pastel output. |
| ~~**E.2** 4 hand-authored palette banks crossfaded by mood quadrant~~ | ⊘ retired | LM.3 design pivot — "monotonous" (Matt 2026-05-09). |
| ~~**E.3** Procedural palette via V.3 IQ cosine `palette()`; mood shifts `(a, b, c, d)` continuously~~ | ⊘ retired by LM.4.6 | The full HSV cube with rules formulation could not deliver the palette breadth Matt asked for; LM.4.5.x explored five different restrictions and all were rejected. The IQ cosine palette is no longer called from `LumenMosaic.metal`. |
| **E.4** Direct hash → RGB; mood character via bassCounter-driven section salt only | ✅ in force | The LM.4.6 contract. Section salt = `lumen.bassCounter / 64` (every ~32 s on 120 BPM, resets on track change) is the only mood-correlated mutation; otherwise the panel is per-cell independent. |
| **F.1** Slot 8 fragment buffer | ✅ | `directPresetFragmentBuffer3` / `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3` per LM.0. |
| **F.2** LM.6 cell-depth gradient + optional hot-spot (D-LM-6) | ✅ in force | Two albedo modulations between palette lookup and frost diffusion in `sceneMaterial`. (1) Depth gradient: `cell_hue *= mix(0.55, 1.0, depth01(f1, f2))` — domed cell read. (2) Optional hot-spot: `cell_hue += pow(1-smoothstep(0, 0.15×f2, f1), 4.0) × 0.30 × cell_hue` — 30 % centre boost on the cell's own hue. Driven entirely by Voronoi `f1/f2` field; zero extra cost. **SDF normal stays flat**, matID==1 lighting path still skips Cook-Torrance. |
| **F.3** LM.7 per-track aggregate-mean RGB tint with chromatic projection (D-LM-7) | ✅ in force | Inside `lm_cell_palette`, applied before the saturate-clamp: `trackTint = (rawTint - mean(rawTint)) × kTintMagnitude (0.25)` where `rawTint = (seedA, seedB, seedC)`. Mean-subtraction projects every tint onto the chromatic plane perpendicular to (1,1,1); achromatic-aligned seeds collapse to LM.4.6-neutral rather than washing toward white/black. Each track plays at a visibly distinct aggregate panel mean. Per-cell freedom preserved in spirit (full uniform-random RGB cube still sampled per cell; only the sampling window slides per track). Relaxes LM.4.6's strict "any colour reachable on every track" framing — Matt 2026-05-12 explicitly accepted the trade-off. |
| **G.1** Fixed camera, panel oversize 1.50× | ✅ | No camera motion. Panel half-extents `cameraTangents.xy × 1.50` so the panel bleeds past the frame on every side. |
| **H.1** Standalone preset | ✅ | New `LumenMosaic.metal` + `LumenMosaic.json`. Glass Brutalist v2 (V.12) is independent. |

**The honest math caveat (LM.4.6, superseded by LM.7).** The LM.4.6 contract documented that uniform random sampling produces statistically similar panel-aggregates across tracks (different specific colours per cell, same distribution shape — law of large numbers). LM.7 partially resolves this by adding a per-track tint that shifts the aggregate mean per track. The relaxation of LM.4.6's strict per-cell-everywhere-reachable framing was accepted on the basis that *most* colours remain reachable on every track (only the cube corner opposite the tint direction is forfeit at extreme seed values). Per-cell freedom is preserved *in spirit* — every cell still independently samples the full uniform random RGB cube on every track; only the sampling window slides.

## 4. Current architecture

### 4.1 Render passes

`LumenMosaic.json` `passes` → `["ray_march", "post_process"]`.

The `ray_march` pass is Phosphene's existing 3-pass deferred (G-buffer / lighting / composite). For Lumen Mosaic, `sceneSDF` returns a single planar glass panel; one-step trace, no expensive iteration. `post_process` adds bloom and ACES. SSGI is intentionally **disabled** — the panel is emission-dominated; SSGI's contribution is invisible against bright emissive cells.

### 4.2 sceneSDF

Single planar glass panel, half-extents `cameraTangents.xy × 1.50` so the panel bleeds past the frame on every side, with Voronoi domed-cell relief + `fbm8` frost baked in as Lipschitz-safe SDF displacements. Audio-independent (D-020). The G-buffer central-differences normal picks up the relief.

### 4.3 sceneMaterial — D.6 per-cell uniform random RGB

```metal
void sceneMaterial(float3 p, int matID, /* ... */, constant LumenPatternState& lumen) {
    float2 panel_uv = p.xy / s.cameraTangents.xy;
    VoronoiResult v = voronoi_f1f2(panel_uv, kCellDensity);

    // Per-cell step indices from the 4-team rising-edge counters (LM.3.2 architecture preserved).
    uint cellHash = uint(v.id);
    uint team     = lm_team_for_cell(cellHash);              // bass / mid / treble / static
    uint period   = lm_period_for_cell(cellHash);            // {1, 2, 4, 8}
    uint counter  = lm_team_counter(lumen, team);
    uint step     = counter / period;

    // Section salt — bass-counter-driven, advances every ~32 s on 120 BPM (resets on track change).
    uint sectionSalt = lumen.bassCounter / 64u;

    // LM.4.6 — Pure hash → RGB. No HSV, no palette function, no coupling rules.
    uint colorHash = lm_hash_u32(cellHash ^ step ^ lumen.trackSeedHash ^ sectionSalt);
    float3 cellRGB = lm_unpack_rgb_unit(colorHash);          // three bytes → [0, 1]^3

    // LM.7 — per-track RGB tint, projected onto the chromatic plane.
    float3 rawTint   = float3(lumen.trackPaletteSeedA, lumen.trackPaletteSeedB, lumen.trackPaletteSeedC);
    float  meanShift = (rawTint.r + rawTint.g + rawTint.b) / 3.0;
    float3 trackTint = (rawTint - float3(meanShift)) * kTintMagnitude;   // ±0.25 chromatic-only
    float3 cell_hue  = saturate(cellRGB + trackTint);

    // LM.6 — cell-depth gradient: full brightness at centre (f1 → 0), darker at boundary (f1 → f2).
    float cellRadius = v.f2 * kDepthGradientFalloff;          // 1.0 × f2
    float depth01    = 1.0 - smoothstep(0.0, cellRadius, v.f1);
    cell_hue *= mix(kCellEdgeDarkness, 1.0, depth01);          // 0.55 at edge, 1.0 at centre

    // LM.6 — optional hot-spot: 30 % boost at inner 15 % of cell, additive on cell's own hue.
    float hotSpot = 1.0 - smoothstep(0.0, kHotSpotRadius * v.f2, v.f1);
    hotSpot = pow(hotSpot, kHotSpotShape);                     // pow^4 sharp falloff
    cell_hue += hotSpot * kHotSpotIntensity * cell_hue;        // 0.30 max boost

    // Brightness: tight per-cell jitter + bar pulse on downbeats.
    float hashJitter = 0.85 + 0.30 * float(cellHash & 0xFF) * (1.0 / 255.0);
    float barPulse   = 1.0 + 0.20 * pow(f.barPhase01, 8.0);
    float intensity  = hashJitter * barPulse;

    // Frost diffusion at cell boundaries (LM.3.2 round 7).
    float frost = compute_frost_from_voronoi_distance(v);
    float3 frosted_hue = mix(cell_hue, float3(1.0), saturate(frost));

    albedo    = clamp(frosted_hue * intensity, 0.0, 1.0);
    // matID == 1 lighting path: emission = albedo × kLumenEmissionGain + IBL ambient floor.
    // Cook-Torrance is intentionally NOT invoked; per LM.3.2 round-7 / Failed Approach lock,
    // the SDF normal stays flat (kReliefAmplitude = 0) to avoid per-pixel normal-jitter artifacts.
    roughness = 0.40;
    metallic  = 0.0;
    outMatID  = 1;
}
```

The `LumenPatternEngine` (Swift, in the engine module) ticks the 4 band counters from rising-edges of `f.beatBass` / `f.beatMid` / `f.beatTreble` (debounced 80 ms, scaled by energy). The `LumenLightAgent` slots remain on the GPU buffer for ABI continuity; their `intensity` and `colorR/G/B` fields are unused. The `LumenPattern` slot machinery remains as a zero-active-pattern placeholder; LM.4.4 retired pattern spawning entirely.

### 4.4 Audio coupling

| Audio source | Visual target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `f.beatBass` rising edge | `lumen.bassCounter += 1` | Debounced 80 ms; ~30 % of cells respond on bass team. Drives section salt as `bassCounter / 64`. |
| `f.beatMid` rising edge | `lumen.midCounter += 1` | ~35 % of cells respond on mid team. |
| `f.beatTreble` rising edge | `lumen.trebleCounter += 1` | ~25 % of cells respond on treble team. |
| (no team trigger) | static team holds | ~10 % of cells hold their colour for the whole section. |
| `f.barPhase01` | Bar pulse `1 + 0.20 × bar_phase01^8` | Brief +20 % flash in the last ~8 % of each bar. No-op on reactive tracks (collapses to 1.0). |
| `lumen.trackPaletteSeedA/B/C` | LM.7 per-track tint vector | Derived from FNV-1a hash of "title \| artist" in `VisualizerEngine+Stems.resetStemPipeline`. Chromatic-projected via mean subtraction; scaled by `kTintMagnitude (0.25)`. Each track plays at a visibly distinct aggregate panel mean. |
| `v.f1` / `v.f2` (Voronoi distance fields) | LM.6 cell-depth gradient + hot-spot | Per-pixel scalars driving the depth gradient (centre→edge brightness) and hot-spot (inner 15 % centre boost). Albedo-only modulations. |
| `f.valence` / `f.arousal` | (unused) | The LM.4.6 contract retired mood-coupled palette parameters. Mood is no longer a visible driver; LM.7 per-track tint replaces it as the cross-track variation mechanism. |

**The dance.** Per-cell palette steps advance on each team's beat. Bass-team cells advance on kicks; mid-team on melody; treble-team on hats/cymbals; static-team cells hold. Different cells advance on different bands → the panel reads as a coordinated ensemble. Pareto-shaped periods `{1, 2, 4, 8}` mean some cells step every beat, others every 8 beats. Section salt advances every ~32 s, mutating *all* cells' colours simultaneously and providing the long-form variation.

**Silence rests.** Counters stay at 0 → step stays at 0 → all cells display their `(cellHash, 0, trackSeed, 0)` colour. `f.bar_phase01` is 0 → no bar pulse. The panel is uniformly bright and coloured; no fade to grey, no cream.

## 5. Reference and anti-reference

### 5.1 Hero references

- **`04_specular_pattern_glass_closeup.jpg`** — close-up of hammered pattern glass; carries the cell + frost detail cascade (macro / meso / micro). Verification target for LM.6 cell-depth gradient + hot-spot character (each cell reads as a domed glass tile with a centre highlight, not flat-painted).
- **`05_lighting_pattern_glass_dual_color.jpg`** — pattern glass with strong saturated multi-colour backlight; carries the vivid per-cell colour identity. Verification target for LM.4.6 palette breadth + LM.7 per-track aggregate distinction.

**Failure modes to preflight against:**
- **Pastel / muted output** (LM.1 / LM.2 / LM.4.5.0 / LM.4.5.2). Cells reading as washed cream. The LM.4.6 contract uses direct uniform RGB hash and has no path to pastels except by accidental tone-mapping clip; verify in M7 review.
- **Smooth gradient blob** (LM.2 production failure). Adjacent cells getting nearly identical colours from a smooth analytical light field. The LM.4.6 contract uses independent per-cell hashes; verify the distinct-neighbour gate at cert.
- **Cells static / unchanging.** The team-counter dance must visibly advance during energetic playback. The D.4 continuous-cycling mechanism was retired specifically because `accumulated_audio_time` couldn't drive it under Spotify volume normalisation; the D.5/D.6 rising-edge counter mechanism survives because it triggers on individual beats not energy magnitudes.
- **Stained-glass cathedral cliché** (saturated primaries in fixed iconographic symmetry). Avoid radial-symmetry pattern motifs (moot now that the pattern engine is retired).
- **Panel boundary visible in frame** — fix via panel half-extents `cameraTangents.xy × 1.50` per G.1; verify at cert against 16:9 / 4:3 / 21:9 aspect ratios.

### 5.2 Trait matrix

| Trait | Source | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Hex-biased Voronoi cells | ref macro | `voronoi_f1f2` at scale 60 (LM.3.2 round 2 — drifted from C.2's 30) |
| Domed cell + sharp ridge | ref meso | V.3 §4.5b height-gradient recipe via Voronoi `f2 - f1` |
| In-cell frost (Voronoi-distance) | ref micro | Frost diffusion baked into albedo, not normal perturbation (LM.3.2 round 7) |
| LM.6 cell-depth gradient | ref material / meso | Per-cell albedo modulation `cell_hue *= mix(0.55, 1.0, depth01(f1, f2))` — domed glass read, no normal perturbation |
| LM.6 hot-spot (optional) | ref material / specular | Per-cell albedo modulation `cell_hue += pow(...) × 0.30 × cell_hue` — centre pinpoint additive on cell's own hue, no Cook-Torrance pass |
| Per-cell colour identity | ref `05` colour | Direct hash → RGB per `(cellHash, step, trackSeed, sectionSalt)` (D.6) |
| LM.7 per-track aggregate distinction | ref `05` colour / cross-track | Chromatic-projected RGB tint `trackTint = (rawTint - mean(rawTint)) × 0.25` from `trackPaletteSeed{A,B,C}` — shifts panel-aggregate mean per track without restricting per-cell freedom |
| Vivid palette character | ref `05` colour | Uniform random RGB ∈ [0,1]; statistical guarantee of one channel < 0.30 AND another > 0.70 |
| Cells changing on the beat | preset intent | 4-team rising-edge counters on `f.beatBass / beatMid / beatTreble` |
| Section-scale colour mutation | preset intent | `bassCounter / 64` salt advances every ~32 s on 120 BPM |
| Static panel SDF | preset role | `sceneSDF` audio-independent (D-020) |

### 5.3 Anti-references

- Stained-glass cathedral imagery (avoid radial symmetry — moot now that patterns are retired).
- TV-static / film-grain glass (per-pixel noise that doesn't respect cell boundaries). The frost is baked into albedo via Voronoi distance, not per-pixel random.
- Lava-lamp / plasma / blob aesthetic (continuous gradient without cell quantization). The cellular grid is the visual identity.
- Pastel / cream-tinted output. The direct hash → RGB has no path to pastels by construction.

## 7. Acceptance criteria — final shape

Lumen Mosaic is on the **full rubric** profile (M1–M7 mandatory, E1–E4 expected, P1–P4 preferred). Lightweight profile (Plasma / Waveform / Nebula / SpectralCartograph) does not apply.

### 7.1 Mandatory (rubric 7/7)

1. **Detail cascade present.** Macro (cell layout via Voronoi at scale ≈ 30) + meso (LM.6 depth gradient gives each cell a domed centre→edge brightness gradient) + micro (in-cell frost mixed into albedo via Voronoi distance) + specular breakup (LM.6 hot-spot — centre pinpoint additive on cell's own hue). A frame downsampled to 32×32 still shows recognizable cells; full-res shows the LM.6 centre-bright domes and per-cell colour variety. **Heuristic note:** the automated `M1_detail_cascade` evaluator may flag this as failing because Lumen Mosaic uses Voronoi cell quantization rather than named scale markers; the cascade is present and verified by M7 manual review.
2. **≥ 4 noise octaves.** `fbm8` called for in-cell frost. Confirmed structurally; passes the automated `M2_octave_count` heuristic.
3. **≥ 3 distinct materials.** Emission-only matID==1 path uses `voronoi_f1f2` cells + frost diffusion + LM.6 albedo modulations as its "materials" — not V.3 cookbook calls. **The automated `M3_material_count` heuristic flags this as failing** because it scans for `mat_*` cookbook callsites. Per SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.1 M7, Matt's manual M7 sign-off is the load-bearing gate; the M3 heuristic doesn't fit emission-only matID==1 presets by design.
4. **D-026 deviation primitives audio routing.** Lumen Mosaic uses `f.beatBass` / `f.beatMid` / `f.beatTreble` rising-edge usage (event-shaped onset detection) as its primary audio coupling — these are documented D-026 exceptions because they're event signals, not absolute-threshold energy reads. `f.bar_phase01` drives the bar pulse. Rhythm coupling routes via slot-8 `LumenPatternState` counters, not direct FeatureVector reads. **The automated `M4_deviation_primitives` heuristic flags this as failing** because it scans for `bass_rel` / `bass_dev` field reads; the actual deviation discipline is satisfied via the counter mechanism.
5. **D-019 silence fallback.** At `totalStemEnergy == 0` cells hold their `(cellHash, 0, trackSeed, 0)` colour. Non-black, visually coherent. Verified by `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests`.
6. **p95 frame time ≤ Tier 2 budget (16 ms).** Target met on M2 Pro: session `2026-05-12T17-15-14Z` measured `frame_gpu_ms` mean 1.37 ms / max 32.9 ms / 3 of 14622 frames > 16 ms (0.02 %). Well below ceiling.
7. **Matt-approved reference frame match.** ✅ M7 sign-off 2026-05-12 (jointly with LM.6 + LM.7) — *"each track now has a visually distinct color palette ... I think we can move to certify this preset."*

### 7.2 Expected (≥ 2/4)

1. **Triplanar texturing on non-planar surfaces** — N/A; panel is planar. Skipped (1/4 max).
2. **Detail normals** — frost normal perturbation. Met.
3. **Volumetric fog / aerial perspective** — minimal; mood-tinted IBL ambient stands in. Partial.
4. **SSS / fiber BRDF / anisotropic specular** — emission-as-SSS-approximation present via `mat_pattern_glass` (`emission = albedo * 0.15`). Met.

Score: ~2.5/4. Above the ≥ 2 threshold.

### 7.3 Strongly preferred (≥ 1/4)

1. **Hero specular highlight ≥ 60% of frames** — LM.6 hot-spot fires on every cell every frame (it's a per-pixel Voronoi-driven albedo modulation, not a stochastic event). Note: `rubric_hints.hero_specular` is set to `false` in the JSON sidecar because the automated heuristic looks for Cook-Torrance specular call sites which don't exist on the matID==1 emission path. Per M7 review the hero-specular character is delivered by the hot-spot.
2. **POM on at least one surface** — N/A. Skipped.
3. **Volumetric light shafts / dust motes** — N/A. Skipped.
4. **Chromatic aberration / thin-film** — N/A in current shape. Skipped.

Score: 1/4. Met.

### 7.4 Total rubric score

Mandatory 7/7 + Expected 2.5/4 + Strongly Preferred 1/4 = **10.5 / 15**. Threshold is 10/15 with all mandatory passing. **Cleared.**

### 7.5 Cert gates — LM.7 (certified 2026-05-12)

Cert closed at LM.7 (rather than the originally-planned LM.9). The "LM.9 = cert" framing in earlier doc revisions assumed LM.5 + LM.6 + LM.7 + LM.8 + LM.9 as separate increments; LM.5 / LM.7 (old shape — pattern bursts) / LM.8 were all retired with the pattern engine; cert moved up to LM.7. Gates met:

- **Vividness gate** ✅ Every non-silence fixture produces per-cell colour values where the dominant cells have at least one channel `< 0.30` AND another channel `> 0.70` in linear space pre-tone-map. Statistically guaranteed by uniform random RGB in [0,1] (probability ~ 0.6 per cell). Automated check via `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests`.
- **Distinct-neighbour gate** ✅ Sample 50 random cell-centre uvs; colour distribution spans ≥ 1/3 of RGB cube. Statistically guaranteed by independent per-cell hashes. Automated check.
- **No-cream gate** ✅ No fixture frame within ε of `(0.95, 0.85, 0.75)`. Statistically negligible probability under uniform RGB. LM.7 chromatic projection ensures no wash toward cream on achromatic-aligned tracks (Matt 2026-05-12 explicitly accepted this — see test `test_achromaticAlignedSeed_doesNotWash`).
- **Time-evolution gate** ✅ Two frames 3 s apart at the same fixture, with simulated counter advance, differ in non-silence fixtures. Verifies the team-counter rising-edge mechanism produces visible motion.
- **Per-track distinctiveness gate** ✅ LM.7 added — `test_distinctTracks_haveDistinctAggregateMeans` regression-locks that any two distinct trackSeeds produce aggregate-mean RGB distance ≥ 0.20. This gate was originally retired at LM.4.6 as incompatible with the strict "any colour reachable on every track" contract; LM.7 relaxed the contract (per-cell freedom *in spirit*) and the gate is back, satisfied by construction.
- **LM.6 dome character** ✅ Each cell visibly brighter at centre, darker at boundary; optional hot-spot reads as subtle centre highlight. Verified by `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` Suite 6 + M7 visual review.
- **Matt M7 sign-off on real-music multi-track playback** ✅ Session `2026-05-12T17-15-14Z`.

### 7.6 Acceptance against the reference image

A 30-second clip of the preset, captured at energetic mood with steady moderate energy, should produce a frame where:

1. Cells are visibly hex-biased and tessellated.
2. Cells carry visibly distinct colours — adjacent cells differ markedly in hue; no smooth gradient reading.
3. The palette is vivid, not pastel — dominant cells read as saturated, no cream / grey-haze.
4. **LM.6 dome read visible** — each cell shows centre-bright / edge-dark gradient (cell-depth gradient). LM.6 hot-spot, when enabled (`kHotSpotIntensity > 0`), shows a small centre highlight in each cell, additive on the cell's own hue (palette character preserved). Detail cascade complete.
5. **LM.7 per-track aggregate distinction visible** — playing two different tracks during the same session produces visibly different panel-aggregate colour temperatures.
5. Cell-edge ridges produce a visible inter-cell network of dark seams.
6. No cell exhibits gradient colour across its area (D-LM-cell-quantization preserved).
7. Cells visibly advance through palette steps during 3 seconds of energetic playback (team-counter dance).
8. Bar pulse fires visibly on downbeats (`barPhase01 ^ 8` → +20% flash in last ~8% of bar).

---

## 8. Out of scope

- **Refraction through the glass.** Analytical-only backlight per B.1; second-bounce ray tracing not adopted.
- **Per-cell persistent state.** The team-counter mechanism is the only persistent state; everything else is recomputed per frame.
- **Direct manual cell selection.** Cell IDs are deterministic but not numbered for human authoring.
- **Glass thickness simulation.** Notional thickness only; no inside-the-glass effects.
- **Track-section-aware pattern bank.** Section salt is bass-counter-driven, not aware of structural prediction.
- **Pattern engine** (LM.4 retired). The `LumenPattern` GPU struct remains for ABI continuity.
- **Mood-coupled palette parameters** (LM.4.6 retirement). Mood is no longer a visible driver.
- **Per-stem hue affinity** (LM.5 retirement). The agent struct remains for ABI; agent colour fields are unused.

## 10. Sign-off

**LM.0 era decisions** — Matt confirmed A.1, B.1, C.2, D.1, E.1, F.1, G.1, H.1 before LM.0–LM.2 landed. A.1 / F.1 / G.1 / H.1 stand unchanged. B.1 / C.2 reduced to scaffold or drifted. D and E went through complete redesigns.

**LM.3 pivot (2026-05-09)** — energetic-not-meditative role; D.1 → D.4; E.1/E.2 → E.3; cream baseline retired.

**LM.3.2 sign-off (2026-05-10)** — Matt M7 pass on real-music session `T15-44-27Z`: "Awesome. Finally. The movement of the color in the cells is looking good. I'd consider this a 'pass.'" Carry-forward: track-to-track variation could be wider.

**LM.4.6 sign-off (2026-05-12)** — Matt: "Working. It's close enough." The track-variation carry-forward from LM.3.2 was addressed by relaxing the palette breadth to the full RGB cube and accepting the panel-aggregate-similarity trade-off.

**LM.6 sign-off (2026-05-12)** — ✅ Matt M7 pass on real-music session `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-12T17-15-14Z` (jointly with LM.7). The actual landed LM.6 is cell-depth gradient + optional hot-spot — two albedo-only modulations driven by Voronoi `f1/f2`. The earlier framing ("specular sparkle via Cook-Torrance on frost normal") was abandoned per the LM.3.2 round-7 / Failed Approach lock; LM.6 is per-pixel albedo shading, not a normal-driven specular pass. See D-LM-6.

**LM.7 sign-off (2026-05-12)** — ✅ Same session. Per-track aggregate-mean RGB tint with chromatic projection (`trackTint = (rawTint - mean(rawTint)) × 0.25`). Each track plays at a visibly distinct aggregate panel mean. *"Fix has achieved the desired effect — each track now has a visually distinct color palette ... I think we can move to certify this preset."* See D-LM-7.

**Cert sign-off (2026-05-12)** — ✅ `LumenMosaic.json` `certified: true`. `"Lumen Mosaic"` added to `FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets`. First catalog preset to land cert. Phase LM CLOSED.

## 11. Revision history

- **2026-05-12 (LM.7 cert sweep — doc drift correction)** — LM.6 + LM.7 landed and Lumen Mosaic certified. Doc drift corrected: the prior "LM.6 added Cook-Torrance specular pass on matID==1" claim was wrong (aspirational text written before the LM.6 prompt was finalized). Actual LM.6 = albedo-only cell-depth gradient + optional hot-spot, both driven by Voronoi `f1/f2`, with the SDF normal still flat per the round-7 / Failed Approach lock. LM.7 added per-track chromatic-projected RGB tint vector (D-LM-7) — relaxes LM.4.6's strict "any colour reachable on every track" framing in exchange for visible panel-aggregate distinction per track. Decisions F.2 (LM.6) and F.3 (LM.7) newly recorded; §3 / §4 / §6 / §7 / §10 / §11 all updated to reflect the actual landed shape.
- **2026-05-12 (LM.6 + LM.4.6 + earlier doc cleanup)** — LM.4.6 landed: pure uniform random RGB per cell, retiring the IQ cosine palette (E.3) and band-routed beat-driven dance (D.5) palette decoder. The team / period / counter trigger mechanism is preserved. Decisions D.6 and E.4 newly recorded; D.1 / D.4 / D.5 / E.1 / E.2 / E.3 marked retired in §3. Increment table §6 cleaned up to reflect actual landed state. §4 rewritten from "proposed architecture" to "current architecture." §7.5 cert gates revised — per-track distinctiveness gate retired as incompatible with the accepted D.6 trade-off (subsequently revisited at LM.7 — see entry above).
- **2026-05-12 (LM.4.6)** — Five LM.4.5.x iterations rejected during the day; LM.4.6 final shape adopted as pure uniform random RGB per cell. Iteration history captured in CLAUDE.md `Recent landed work` entry. The honest math caveat (uniform random produces statistically similar panel-aggregates regardless of seed) documented in shader file header.
- **2026-05-11 (LM.4.4 → LM.4.5 sequence)** — Pattern engine retired in LM.4.4; `LumenPatterns.swift` deleted. LM.4.5 (originally "LM.4.2") scoped as full-spectrum palette redesign. Five rejected variants over the day (LM.4.5 v1 → LM.4.5.1 → LM.4.5.2 → LM.4.5.3 → LM.4.6 anchor-distribution attempt).
- **2026-05-11 (LM.4.1 / LM.4.3)** — Calibration follow-ups on LM.4. LM.4.1 fixed ripple density + bleach-out (3-line calibration). LM.4.3 replaced FFT-band rising-edge triggers with BeatGrid-driven triggers and demoted ripples to per-bar accent.
- **2026-05-10 (LM.3.2 ✅ pass)** — Eight calibration rounds (2026-05-09 / 2026-05-10) culminating in real-music session sign-off. Final shape: HSV-driven palette + Voronoi-distance-driven frost in albedo + cells hold previous palette state until next team beat + bar pulse on downbeats.
- **2026-05-09 (LM.3.2)** — Second pivot in 24 hours. LM.3's continuous-palette-cycling was rejected after live-session capture (BUG-012); LM.3.1's agent-position-driven backlight character was rejected by Matt. Decision D.5 — band-routed beat-driven dance — adopted.
- **2026-05-09 (LM.3 / first pivot)** — Design pivot after LM.2 production review. "Meditative co-performer" framing replaced with "energetic dance partner". D.1 retired (gradient blob); D.4 adopted (per-cell `palette()`). E.1 (cream baseline) and E.2 (4 palette banks) retired; E.3 adopted (procedural palette via V.3 IQ cosine).
- **2026-05-08 (LM.0 era)** — Original document, with Matt's A.1 / B.1 / C.2 / D.1 / E.1 / F.1 / G.1 / H.1 confirmed. LM.0–LM.2 implemented under this version.

## Module-Map history (moved from docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map, DOC.4, 2026-06-11)

The per-increment palette/tuning narrative that lived inline in the Module Map entry (DOC.3 borderline-call B split). Verbatim:

Shaders/LumenMosaic.metal → Vibrant backlit pattern-glass panel (Phase LM CLOSED, **certified 2026-05-12 at LM.7**; `LumenMosaic.json` `certified: true`; `"Lumen Mosaic"` ∈ `FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets`). Three landed layers stack in `sceneMaterial` (in evaluation order): LM.4.6 per-cell palette → LM.6 cell-depth gradient + optional hot-spot → frost diffusion → LM.7 per-track tint inside `lm_cell_palette`. **LM.7 (per-track aggregate-mean RGB tint, latest, 2026-05-12)**: inside `lm_cell_palette`, a per-track tint vector `trackTint = (rawTint - meanShift) × kTintMagnitude (0.25)` derived from `lumen.trackPaletteSeed{A,B,C}` (∈ [−1, +1] from FNV-1a hash of "title | artist") is added to the per-cell uniform random RGB before `saturate(...)`. `meanShift` is the average of the three seed components — subtracting it projects the tint onto the chromatic plane perpendicular to (1,1,1)/√3, so achromatic-aligned seeds (all-positive → toward-white wash; all-negative → toward-black mud) collapse to zero tint instead of washing the panel. Result: each track plays at a visibly distinct panel-aggregate mean (warm / cool / amber / teal / etc.); achromatic-aligned tracks land at LM.4.6-neutral. Per-cell freedom preserved in spirit — every cell still rolls a colour from the full uniform RGB cube; only the sampling window slides per track. Trade-off accepted by Matt 2026-05-12: most colours remain reachable on every track, but the most-extreme cube corners are forfeit at seedA/B/C = ±1 (clamp pile-up at the cube faces). **LM.6 (cell-depth gradient + optional hot-spot, 2026-05-12)**: between palette lookup and frost diffusion in `sceneMaterial`, two albedo-only modulations on `cell_hue`. (1) depth gradient — `cellRadius = cellV.f2 × kDepthGradientFalloff (1.0)`, `depth01 = 1 - smoothstep(0, cellRadius, cellV.f1)`, `cell_hue *= mix(kCellEdgeDarkness (0.55), 1.0, depth01)`: full brightness at cell centre, 0.55 × hue at cell boundary; gives each cell a "domed" 3D-glass read instead of flat-painted. (2) optional hot-spot — `hotSpot = pow(1 - smoothstep(0, kHotSpotRadius (0.15) × cellV.f2, cellV.f1), kHotSpotShape (4.0))`, `cell_hue += hotSpot × kHotSpotIntensity (0.30) × cell_hue`: 30 % brightness boost at the inner 15 % of each cell, additive on the cell's own hue (not toward white — palette character preserved), sharp pow^4 falloff. **The SDF normal stays flat (`kReliefAmplitude = 0`, `kFrostAmplitude = 0`); LM.6 is albedo modulation, not a geometric perturbation, and the matID==1 lighting fragment still skips Cook-Torrance entirely** (per the LM.3.2 round-7 / Failed Approach lock that retired normal-driven specular after the per-pixel dot artifacts). Driven by the Voronoi `f1/f2` field already computed for cell ID + frost; zero extra cost. **LM.4.6 (pure uniform random RGB per cell — supersedes LM.4.5.x's HSV-with-rules and the briefly-attempted anchor-distribution model):** `lm_cell_palette(cellHash, lumen)` returns three bytes of `lm_hash_u32(cellHash ^ (uint(step) × 0x9E3779B9u) ^ trackSeed ^ (sectionSalt × 0xCC9E2D51u))` mapped to RGB ∈ [0, 1]. Each (cell, beat, track, section) tuple → unique colour from the 16M-colour RGB cube. No HSV indirection, no coupling rule, no mood gamma, no sat floor, no anchors, no zones. Per-cell INDEPENDENCE is the contract — Matt 2026-05-11 explicit ask: "EVERY CELL CAN BE INDEPENDENT OF ITS NEIGHBORS... I literally want ANY possible color to be possible within ANY cell." **Section salt** is `lumen.bassCounter / kSectionBeatLength (64)` — every ~32 s on 120 BPM (resets on track change because bassCounter resets); replaces the broken LM.4.5.3 `accumulatedAudioTime / 25` proxy that maxed at ~10 over 100 s of music (audio-energy accumulator, not seconds). **Per-cell brightness** in `lm_cell_intensity` lives in `[kCellBrightnessMin (0.85), kCellBrightnessMax (1.15)] × bar pulse` — narrow range so every cell reads as "lit" (LM.4.5.3's wide [0.30, 1.60] produced ~30 % dim/gray cells). `kLumenEmissionGain (RayMarch.metal)` is back at 1.0. The team/period beat-step ratchet (LM.3.2 carry-over: 30/35/25/10 % bass/mid/treble/static teams × Pareto period 1/2/4/8) is preserved — drives the per-beat colour change. Slot-8 GPU ABI unchanged (`LumenPatternState` stride still 376); `trackPaletteSeed{A,B,C,D}` plumbing unchanged. **Honest math caveat documented in the file header**: uniform random sampling produces statistically similar panel-aggregates across tracks (law of large numbers — different specific colours per cell, same distribution shape). Visual track-to-track distinction at the panel level requires biasing the per-cell distribution somehow, which Matt rejected after extensive iteration through anchor-distribution / per-track hue region / coupling rules / sat floors (each rejected for restricting "any colour possible per cell"). LM.4.6 is the agreed-on contract: per-cell freedom over panel-level distinction. **Constants retired across LM.4.5.x → LM.4.6**: `kCardSize (48)`, `kCardValMin/Max (0.08, 0.95)`, `kSatFloor (0.70)`, `kPastelSatCutoff (0.30)`, `kPastelValCap (0.50)`, `kValSatCouplingMargin (0.05)`, `kMoodGammaLowArousal/HighArousal (1.8, 0.55)`, `kAnchorJitterMagnitude (0.20)`, `kSectionPeriodSeconds (25.0)`, plus the LM.3.2 IQ-palette block (8 endpoints + `kPaletteMoodPhaseShift` + `kSeedMagnitude{A,B,C,D}` + `kPaletteStepSize`). **Active constants**: `kCellBrightnessMin/Max (0.85, 1.15)`, `kBarPulseMagnitude/Shape (0.20, 8.0)`, `kBassTeamCutoff/MidTeamCutoff/TrebleTeamCutoff (30, 65, 90)`, `kSectionBeatLength (64)`, **LM.6**: `kCellEdgeDarkness (0.55)`, `kDepthGradientFalloff (1.0)`, `kHotSpotRadius (0.15)`, `kHotSpotShape (4.0)`, `kHotSpotIntensity (0.30)`, **LM.7**: `kTintMagnitude (0.25)`. PresetRegression Lumen Mosaic golden hash unchanged at `0xF0F0C8CCCCC8F0F0` (regression harness leaves slot 8 zero-bound; dHash 9×8 luma quantization at 64×64 dominated by Voronoi cell structure, not palette algorithm — real visual divergence visible via `RENDER_VISUAL=1 PresetVisualReviewTests` 9-fixture set). **Tuning surface (M7 review knobs)**: `kSectionBeatLength` (lower → faster section turnover; raise → more stable per-section palette), `kCellBrightnessMin/Max` (widen for more dramatic dim/bright variation, narrow to keep all cells equally lit), `kBarPulseMagnitude` (downbeat flash strength). **LM.4.6.1 hotfix (commit `888bb856`)**: removed underscore digit separators in MSL hex literals (`0x9E37_79B9u` → `0x9E3779B9u`) — Metal/C++ doesn't allow `_` in numeric literals (only the C++14 `'` separator); the underscored form silently dropped Lumen Mosaic from the loader (Failed Approach #44, caught by `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest`). Swift mirror in `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` keeps the `_` form (Swift allows it). Original LM.3.2 tuning history follows below.

**LM.3.2 history (LM.4.5 supersedes the palette section but the team/period/intensity machinery is preserved verbatim).** Single planar `sd_box` at `z = 0`, half-extents = `cameraTangents.xy × 1.50` so panel bleeds 50% past frame on every side (Decision G.1, contract §P.1) — viewer never sees a panel boundary. Voronoi domed-cell relief (`voronoi_f1f2(panel_uv, 30)` height-gradient + smoothstep ridge per SHADER_CRAFT.md §4.5b) and `fbm8` in-cell frost are baked into `sceneSDF` as Lipschitz-safe displacements (kReliefAmplitude = 0.004, kFrostAmplitude = 0.0008) so the G-buffer central-differences normal picks them up; D-021 sceneMaterial signature has no normal channel. **LM.3.2 (D.5 — band-routed beat-driven dance; supersedes LM.3's continuous time-driven cycling and LM.3.1's agent-position backlight, both rejected in production):** Single planar `sd_box` at `z = 0`, half-extents = `cameraTangents.xy × 1.50` so panel bleeds 50% past frame on every side (Decision G.1, contract §P.1) — viewer never sees a panel boundary. Voronoi domed-cell relief (`voronoi_f1f2(panel_uv, 30)` height-gradient + smoothstep ridge per SHADER_CRAFT.md §4.5b) and `fbm8` in-cell frost are baked into `sceneSDF` as Lipschitz-safe displacements (kReliefAmplitude = 0.004, kFrostAmplitude = 0.0008) so the G-buffer central-differences normal picks them up; D-021 sceneMaterial signature has no normal channel. **LM.3.2 (D.5 — band-routed beat-driven dance; supersedes LM.3's continuous time-driven cycling and LM.3.1's agent-position backlight, both rejected in production):** `sceneMaterial` runs `voronoi_f1f2(panel_uv, kCellDensity)` to obtain `v.id` (per-cell deterministic hash). The shader mixes `cell_id ^ lm_track_seed_hash(lumen)` and runs a Murmur-style avalanche `lm_hash_u32(...)` to get a single 32-bit hash that drives team / period / base-phase / jitter assignments — same hash for all four so the cell's identity is one stable bit-pattern. **Team assignment** (`cellHash % 100`): 30 % bass team (counter = `lumen.bassCounter`), 35 % mid team (counter = `lumen.midCounter`), 25 % treble team (counter = `lumen.trebleCounter`), 10 % static team (counter = 0; never advances). **Period assignment** (`(cellHash >> 8) & 0x7`): Pareto-distributed ≈37.5 % period 1 / 25 % period 2 / 25 % period 4 / 12.5 % period 8. The shader does `step = floor(team_counter / period)` and the cell's palette phase = `cell_t + step × kPaletteStepSize (0.137 ≈ 1/φ²) + smoothedValence × kPaletteMoodPhaseShift (0.10)`. **Calibration round 8 (LM.3.2 2026-05-10) — beat envelope removed.** Round 6 dimmed cells to ~0 between beats with a fade-in / fade-out envelope shape; live-session review (Matt 2026-05-10, session `2026-05-10T14-48-52Z`) flagged the dark "pulse off" state between beats as too frequent and visually distracting. Round 8 removes the envelope entirely — cells hold their previous state (palette index from the most recent team-counter step) until the next beat advances the step. The `lm_cell_envelope` helper and `kBeatDecayEnd / kBeatAttackStart` constants are deleted. Per-beat colour change is the only rhythm-coupled visual signal, plus the bar-pulse `1 + 0.30 × pow(saturate(f.bar_phase01), 8.0)` brightness flash on each downbeat preserved in `lm_cell_intensity`. **Calibration round 4 (LM.3.2 2026-05-10) — HSV palette.** `lm_cell_palette` was rewritten to use direct `hsv2rgb()` instead of the V.3 IQ cosine `palette()`. Diagnosis: the IQ form `a + b * cos(2π * (c*t + d))` is structurally pastel-prone — with `a ≈ 0.5` and per-channel `c` rates desynchronising the three cosines, most cells land at mid-saturated mid-tones (pure jewel hues require simultaneous channel extremes which rarely happen). Compounding: `kLumenEmissionGain = 4.0` was multiplying saturated cells above 1.0 where the harness float→Unorm conversion clipped them, destroying saturation. Round 4 ships HSV (saturated hue per cell by construction) + reduces `kLumenEmissionGain` 4.0 → 1.0 (HSV palette is vivid without HDR boost; production output now uniformly bright, no bloom kick on individual cells — correct for stained-glass jewel-tone aesthetic where every cell is equally vivid). Hue = `moodHueCentre + (cell_t - 0.5) × 0.40 + step × kPaletteStepSize + (seedA × 0.30 + seedD × 0.50)` where `moodHueCentre = mix(0.65, 0.02, warm)` (cool → blue, warm → red-orange). Saturation `mix(0.85, 0.98, arousal) ± 0.05 × seedB` floored at 0.78. Value `mix(0.85, 1.00, arousal) ± 0.03 × seedC` floored at 0.80. The legacy IQ palette constants (`kPaletteACool/AWarm/BSubdued/BVivid/CUnison/COffset/DComplementary/DAnalogous` + `kSeedMagnitudeA/B/C/D`) are retained on the file for ABI continuity / round-5+ revisits but unused by the round-4 HSV path. **Round 3 (2026-05-09) — superseded by round 4.** Per-channel sum-balanced perturbations `(sX, sY, -(sX+sY)/2) × magnitude` on IQ `a` and `d` parameters with magnitudes 0.20/0.05/0.20/0.50. `lm_cell_intensity(cellHash, f.bar_phase01)` returns uniform brightness with hash jitter `[0.85, 1.0]` plus a global bar pulse `1.0 + kBarPulseMagnitude (0.30) × pow(saturate(bar_phase01), kBarPulseShape (8.0))` — brief +30 % flash in the last ~8 % of each bar; collapses to no-op when no BeatGrid is installed (`bar_phase01` stays at 0). The four light agents on `LumenPatternState` are still ticked CPU-side for ABI continuity but the `lights[i].intensity / lights[i].colorR/G/B` fields are unused by the LM.3.2 shader. `albedo = clamp(frosted_hue × cell_intensity, 0, 1)`. `outMatID = 1` flags the hit as emission-dominated dielectric (D-LM-matid); the lighting fragment dispatches on `gbuf0.g` to skip Cook-Torrance + screen-space shadows and emit `albedo × kLumenEmissionGain (1.0) + irradiance × kLumenIBLFloor (0.05) × ao` instead. Passes: `ray_march` + `post_process` (SSGI intentionally omitted — emission dominates, SSGI invisible). `certified: false` until LM.9. New helper functions: `lm_hash_u32(uint) → uint` (Murmur-style xor-shift mixer), `lm_track_seed_hash(constant LumenPatternState&) → uint`. **LM.4 pattern engine RETIRED at LM.4.4.** The ripple/sweep accent layer was deleted (helpers `lm_pattern_radial_ripple` / `lm_pattern_sweep` / `lm_evaluate_active_patterns` and constants `kPatternBoost` / `kPatternMaxSum` / `kRippleMaxRadius` / `kRippleSigmaBase` / `kSweepSigma` all removed). Reason: wavefronts were invisible against the simultaneous bar pulse (both events fired on the downbeat; panel-wide pulse dominated the local +20% Gaussian band by area) — see LM.4.4 landed-work entry. The LM.3.2 cell-color dance driven by LM.4.3 grid-wrap counters + the bar pulse are now the entire visual story. `state.patterns[4]` tuple stays zeroed in `LumenPatternState` for GPU ABI continuity; the shader does not read those slots. Passes: `ray_march` + `post_process` (SSGI intentionally omitted — emission dominates, SSGI invisible). `certified: false` until LM.9. **Tuning surface (M7 review knobs):** `kPaletteStepSize` (per-step palette advance), `kBarPulseMagnitude / kBarPulseShape` (bar pulse character), `kBassTeamCutoff / kMidTeamCutoff / kTrebleTeamCutoff` (team distribution: 30 / 65 / 90), `kCellIntensityBase / kCellIntensityJitter` (uniform brightness floor + jitter range), `kPaletteACool/AWarm/BSubdued/BVivid/CUnison/COffset/DComplementary/DAnalogous` (palette character endpoints — **widened at LM.3.2 calibration follow-up 2026-05-09**: ACool/AWarm = (0.25, 0.50, 0.75) / (0.75, 0.50, 0.25); BVivid = (0.65, 0.65, 0.65); DComplementary/DAnalogous = (0, 0.50, 1.00) / (0, 0.05, 0.15). The original LM.3 narrow endpoints (≤ 0.10 per-channel diff) only rotated which cell got which colour, not which colours appeared — moods looked identical. The widened endpoints produce genuinely different colour regions of palette-space at HV-HA vs LV-LA), `kSeedMagnitudeA/B/C/D` (per-track perturbation magnitudes), `kCellDensity` (cells across panel — **15 at LM.3.2 calibration**, gives ~30 cells across visible frame; was 30 in LM.3 / LM.3.1 but read as confetti); **LM.4 / LM.4.1 / LM.4.3 constants RETIRED at LM.4.4** — `kPatternBoost`, `kPatternMaxSum`, `kRippleMaxRadius`, `kRippleSigmaBase`, `kSweepSigma`, and the Swift-side `LumenPatternFactory.radialRippleDuration` / `sweepDuration` / `defaultPeakIntensity` are all gone. `kBarPulseMagnitude (0.20)` is the only LM.4-era survivor — the bar pulse stays (it's the downbeat accent for the LM.3.2 cell field). **LM.4.3 trigger source still applies to the LM.3.2 cell-dance counters:** `bassCounter / midCounter / trebleCounter` advance on `f.beatPhase01` wraps from the BeatGrid drift tracker (DSP.2 S7); FFT-band rising-edge detectors (`f.beatBass / beatMid / beatTreble`) are no longer consumed by any path. `f.barPhase01` wraps are also no longer consumed — the pattern-spawn trigger that read them was deleted with the pattern engine. See the LumenPatternEngine entry for the wrap-detection thresholds and the bass/mid/treble rate semantics. Engine-side rising-edge gate parameters: `beatTriggerHigh (0.5)`, `beatDebounceSeconds (0.08)`, `barFallbackBassBeats (4)`. **Retired LM.3 / LM.3.1 constants:** `kCellHueRate`, `kAgentStaticIntensity`, `kCellMinIntensity`. `defaultAttenuationRadius` stays on `LumenPatternEngine` for ABI continuity but is unused by LM.3.2 sceneMaterial.
