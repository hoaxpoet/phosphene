// RenderPass — Render-graph pass types shared between the Presets and Renderer modules.
//
// A preset declares its render passes in the `"passes"` JSON sidecar key.
// `RenderPipeline.renderFrame` walks the active passes array and dispatches to the
// first pass whose subsystem is available, replacing the old priority-ordered boolean
// flag chain (useFeedback / useMeshShader / usePostProcess / useRayMarch / useICB).
//
// Adding a new capability requires only: a new `RenderPass` case, one `drawWithX`
// method in `RenderPipeline`, and one `case` in `applyPreset`. No more flag explosion.

// MARK: - RenderPass

/// A single render pass declared in a preset's JSON sidecar.
///
/// Presets declare their render passes as an ordered array under the `"passes"` JSON key:
///
/// ```json
/// { "passes": ["feedback", "particles"] }
/// { "passes": ["mesh_shader"] }
/// { "passes": ["ray_march", "post_process"] }
/// ```
///
/// `RenderPipeline.renderFrame` iterates the active passes array and executes the first
/// pass whose required subsystem is available, falling back to `.direct` if none match.
///
/// **Backward compatibility:** if no `"passes"` key is present in the JSON, `PresetDescriptor`
/// synthesises the array from the legacy `use_feedback`, `use_particles`, `use_mesh_shader`,
/// `use_post_process`, and `use_ray_march` boolean fields.
